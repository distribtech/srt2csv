1
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,700
Kyiv.Winter that changed us.

2
00:00:34,787 --> 00:00:41,975
You are my child, you understand? You have to give
me grandchildren, and you are going under the bullets.

3
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,034
"I love Ukraine". They kill
our children, and you say I love Ukraine.

4
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,000
What kind of love for Ukraine is this? Bendery

5
00:00:51,921 --> 00:01:00,600
Children have to be protected.
Send them not to the first barricade, but to third.

6
00:01:00,624 --> 00:01:06,624
Self-defence.

7
00:01:06,624 --> 00:01:13,424
They take away our rights!
They don't give us our rights!

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You have to understand
that you take responsibility.

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
You have to understand that you take
responsibility for your house and everything here.

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Because if you tell them that something is
gone, it will be a personal problem for you.

11
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I know what I'm doing.

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The fourth is left at the entrance.
Two inside, two outside, near the doors.

13
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Be careful not to break
anything, don't break anything.

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Self-Defense Forces takes it under its protection
the abandoned building of the Ministry of Culture

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,593
so that it doesn't lose its
property and documents.

16
00:01:50,703 --> 00:01:54,562
The man giving out the orders is nicknamed Dobry.

17
00:01:54,562 --> 00:01:59,687
In his everyday life, he is a Kyiv entrepreneur,
who is on the Maidan from the first days.

18
00:01:59,687 --> 00:02:01,406
I have a five-year-old son.

19
00:02:01,406 --> 00:02:04,799
And so that I don't feel
ashamed in front of him,

20
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,812
when he grows up, he will ask,
Dad, what did you do at that time,

21
00:02:07,812 --> 00:02:10,484
when such people ruled our country?

22
00:02:10,484 --> 00:02:13,687
How did you feel? What did you do?

23
00:02:13,687 --> 00:02:19,703
I will tell him that I was engaged in business,
earned money, I realized that I would be ashamed.

24
00:02:19,703 --> 00:02:23,552
I will lie, I will be hypocritical,
and I don't want to live like that.

25
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:28,084
Demonstrators in construction helmets,
ready to defend the peaceful protest,

26
00:02:28,109 --> 00:02:31,171
appeared after the students
were beaten on the Maidan.

27
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:36,609
I came voluntarily.

28
00:02:36,634 --> 00:02:39,796
My heart ached for all
the guys after the 30th.

29
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Quiet!

30
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Knees!

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Quiet!

32
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Why?

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm falling!

34
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
People realized that they had to
defend themselves from the police.

35
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
If suddenly we succeed, God
willing, we succeed today to rest,

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,260
we, in any case, who rests, who
acts, we will be here tomorrow at 10 am.

37
00:03:15,073 --> 00:03:16,776
Attention!

38
00:03:16,776 --> 00:03:18,479
Key points!

39
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:21,000
We are the defense of the peaceful protest.

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,245
Our key task is not to allow the beating
of women and children.

41
00:03:27,245 --> 00:03:31,604
We do not do any aggressive actions.

42
00:03:31,604 --> 00:03:36,776
We only protect the people who
came to the peaceful protest of Kyiv.

43
00:03:36,776 --> 00:03:40,291
After the first public meeting
and clashes with the police

44
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:42,000
under the administration of the President,

45
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
the demonstrators began to build
barricades on the Maidan of Independence.

46
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
The central square of the capital
began to resemble the real Sich.

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
People gathered where
there was a threat of assault.

48
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,245
And it was they who organized
the first self-defense camps.

49
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,604
You have a shield!

50
00:04:02,604 --> 00:04:05,166
You are not there to drive flies away!

51
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:07,120
Fix the shield!

52
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,000
Protect as much as possible!

53
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You are high, you can move,
but you will not be pushed!

54
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,182
This is the most stable
position of a person!

55
00:04:15,182 --> 00:04:17,401
Khan is a former military man.

56
00:04:17,401 --> 00:04:19,807
After the first attempt
to storm the Maidan,

57
00:04:19,807 --> 00:04:23,260
he began to teach people how to withstand
the attacks of the security forces.

58
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:28,588
It became clear that in order to withstand
the pressure, the camps must be organized.

59
00:04:28,588 --> 00:04:31,541
In that way self-defense has
become a full-fledged structure

60
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:35,620
that consisted of hundreds, as it
used to be in the Zaporizhzhya Sich.

61
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:38,000
The most protected people are young people.

62
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
No women, no kids.

63
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,151
This defense on this barricade
is completely self-organized.

64
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:47,000
Without the support of
any party, it is apolitical.

65
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:04,000
Now the countermeasures have begun!

66
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,385
One, two, three!

67
00:05:11,635 --> 00:05:17,000
We are just restraining them, we have no goal
or task to attack the special police unit.

68
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,385
We are only defending ourselves.

69
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:21,000
People who simply pass
and change from time to time.

70
00:05:24,229 --> 00:05:26,000
Here we just united.

71
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,401
The most wrong thing that the current
government has done is to anger people,

72
00:05:31,401 --> 00:05:34,385
and the second thing is that
it gathered us in one place.

73
00:05:34,385 --> 00:05:36,338
It was a point of resistance.

74
00:05:36,338 --> 00:05:38,975
This is the point, people understood
that it needs to be strengthened.

75
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,000
We came here every evening, after a
day or two days, and we were on duty.

76
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,307
We were divided into dozens.

77
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:53,000
We said, guys, you have 12 or 15 people, determine
which of you is the most experienced soldier,

78
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,026
or has some military
experience in managing people.

79
00:05:57,026 --> 00:05:59,000
And then there was a tenner.

80
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
There were moments when during the duty,
at night, the guys re-elected a tenner

81
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,245
if suddenly they didn't like something.

82
00:06:05,245 --> 00:06:08,000
It's all about democracy
in its purest form.

83
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,840
Leave the place immediately!

84
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Every day, self-defense caught provocateurs or pickpockets,
which were appeared at the perimeters of Maidan.

85
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,066
After the interrogation, sometimes
with clubs, they were released.

86
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:28,090
Take his hand!

87
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,100
I calmly give you everything.

88
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,600
Where`s a knife?

89
00:06:46,999 --> 00:06:50,097
This morning, the fighters
arrested a man who was trying

90
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:53,562
to cut off the flags of
Ukraine around the tent town.

91
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,249
Khan at his barricade also fought with
the flags too, although the party ones.

92
00:07:06,531 --> 00:07:14,053
There isn't, wasn't, and won't
be a single flag on this barricade.

93
00:07:14,078 --> 00:07:16,218
I'm giving it to you personally.

94
00:07:16,243 --> 00:07:20,922
And I wanted to tell you-

95
00:07:20,947 --> 00:07:24,383
I'm giving the flags to the party representatives.

96
00:07:24,383 --> 00:07:31,367
But if I see any other party
flags, I won't give it to them.

97
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:32,492
I'm going to destroy them.

98
00:07:32,492 --> 00:07:33,883
I asked you not to hang them.

99
00:07:33,883 --> 00:07:36,000
There are flags in Ukraine, European Union.

100
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And there are Ukrainian nationalists, that's all.

101
00:07:48,414 --> 00:07:54,649
Again, this is the difference between
the Soviet and non-Soviet approach.

102
00:07:54,649 --> 00:08:02,000
The Soviet approach is that it's not all mine,
but I'm at the uncle's service, whose it is.

103
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Or in the party.

104
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Or in someone else's.

105
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,590
And self-defense and the
civil society and, let's say,

106
00:08:11,602 --> 00:08:17,000
the essence of the Maidan,
in fact, are still people.

107
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,664
These are nations that we
believe that we are on our own land.

108
00:08:21,664 --> 00:08:29,000
The rules of behavior on this land and the
laws that do not work and all this horror.

109
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
This is not normal for life.

110
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I'm going to the Maidan,
so I'm going home again.

111
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Self-defense was patrolled
every night, several times.

112
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:58,000
To track how the police forces move around the
Maidan and be ready for a possible assault.

113
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Behind them is Berkut.

114
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,602
I'll take the 6th.

115
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,975
Behind them is Berkut.

116
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:13,000
We are now turning around and running.

117
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
No, we don't have to
run, we just go quietly.

118
00:09:17,025 --> 00:09:19,000
Let's go.

119
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,024
I'll be back.

120
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I have nothing against you.

121
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I am sure you have nothing against me
too, because we don't even know each other.

122
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
We don't even know each other.

123
00:09:33,446 --> 00:09:37,274
Just think before doing anything.

124
00:09:37,274 --> 00:09:43,000
Before going forward, and you will go forward,
before doing something, think for a second.

125
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,633
What are you doing? Really.

126
00:09:45,633 --> 00:09:51,000
Today, tomorrow will pass, the orders will also
pass, tomorrow will come, the day after tomorrow.

127
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
What will happen next?

128
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Our band, which will be.

129
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,664
And then take with you the same
brethren, with the same hand.

130
00:10:01,664 --> 00:10:06,000
And sign up for self-defense today.

131
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
We don't let such people.

132
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I want to show you.

133
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I worked in Donbass
for 10 years as a soldier.

134
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I was detaining Sokol.

135
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Either from Lviv or Donetsk, it doesn't
matter to us, we have nothing to do with it.

136
00:10:26,024 --> 00:10:30,024
We only let people in when they are sober.

137
00:10:30,025 --> 00:10:33,000
What language do you speak?

138
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I like everything, language.

139
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
There is no difference for me.
Everyone speaks in the language they know.

140
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
What about Ukrainian?

141
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Ukrainian, Russian, same thing to us.

142
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
We don't have anything that we
ban Russian language.

143
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,800
I speak Ukrainian!

144
00:10:50,824 --> 00:10:52,824
Alright.

145
00:10:52,848 --> 00:10:55,048
Let`s go. 
Sorry.

146
00:10:59,975 --> 00:11:06,000
At 6, when the subway opened, a lot
of drunkards came crawling from there.

147
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,502
In the morning there is always
as we call it a "drunk storm".

148
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,205
People were constantly
passing.

149
00:11:11,205 --> 00:11:17,000
We send them to the Teatralna station so
that they don't even come close to Maidan.

150
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,800
Attention! Attention! Hold it!

151
00:11:21,815 --> 00:11:29,975
Today we are going to
the barricade at Yanukovych's cortege in Mezhyhirya.

152
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:38,000
We will picket a possible cortege
exit from two exits in Mezhyhirya.

153
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,040
For people who live nearby 
and suffer from the noise you create,

154
00:11:57,064 --> 00:12:06,264
we remind you that the law provides for administrative liability 
for violation of silence between 22:00 and 8:00.

155
00:12:06,288 --> 00:12:09,388
Stop the noise! Respect the rights of others!

156
00:13:12,021 --> 00:13:21,915
I, at my 72 years old, paid the last 50 hryvnias
for a taxi to come here and support my people.

157
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:27,580
And what are you doing? You
have black suits and black souls.

158
00:13:36,975 --> 00:13:42,883
The 11th played a very important role in the fact
our enemies saw how quickly Maidan could expand.

159
00:13:42,908 --> 00:13:48,000
What they see, through the optics, through the
cameras, through the observers, through the knockers.

160
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
They know, there are
3,000 or 5,000 people here.

161
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,705
But then, hop, two hours pass,
and there are 15,000 people here.

162
00:13:55,705 --> 00:13:58,924
And after two hours, there
are already 50,000 people here.

163
00:13:58,924 --> 00:14:01,000
And in the morning, almost
a million people come.

164
00:14:03,674 --> 00:14:11,000
It was simply cynical to sit at home, knowing that the
story has come, and to be a spectator of this process.

165
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Because they say, well, guys, come on, come
on, we are worried about you on Maidan.

166
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
And to be safe, in warmth, in comfort.

167
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,393
Therefore, I realized that for me it was
hypocrisy, and I went there, to be a participant.

168
00:14:23,455 --> 00:14:27,000
I think the logic is this. They said, we are
building a barricade on Olgirskaya Street.

169
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
This is the street that goes down.

170
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
These people began, as I understand it,
to guard until they build this barricade.

171
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,690
From whom?

172
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:36,000
But if suddenly, these
people will come here.

173
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,393
From where? From there?

174
00:14:38,393 --> 00:14:40,000
From there, from the Bankova.

175
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
From Bankova? They won't leave.

176
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
No, well, I know.

177
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Well, why did they put it?

178
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Well, this is my opinion.

179
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I say, if they have nothing
to do, let them build it.

180
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,643
Well, what an idiot to build a barricade close,
roughly speaking, to the enemy territory.

181
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,674
We just always waited for them to shoot,
just to put a machine gun on the building

182
00:15:10,674 --> 00:15:15,000
and some night they will just start shooting the
Maidan from some high building, like this, straight.

183
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Well, it almost turned out that
way, but they shot from Institutska.

184
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Here, and with snipers.

185
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,000
And so, of course, from the point of view of
defense, all this, how to say, it was conditional.

186
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
It was with the condition that
they would not shoot at us.

187
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
There is a concept of honor and dignity of the
officer, yes, there is a oath, something else.

188
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
And the code of honor.

189
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,301
The rules of war, the laws
of war imply that an attack on a

190
00:15:43,313 --> 00:15:48,000
building and a car marked with a red
cross or a red crescent is prohibited.

191
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Right?

192
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,133
It is forbidden to shoot
non-combatants, that is, people

193
00:15:53,145 --> 00:15:57,000
who are not regular
fighters of regular units, right?

194
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Well, roughly speaking,
there was a mass protest here.

195
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Yes, there is acceleration according
to the instructions, but women.

196
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,221
That is, did they pose
a threat to them? No.

197
00:16:05,221 --> 00:16:08,000
Did the doctors pose a threat? No.

198
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Why are they shooting at them?

199
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I will never understand this,
and we will never forgive this.

200
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,027
There is such a man from Kharkiv,
Hobkin or Dobkin, the one who

201
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:27,643
promised that he would dress
as a Berkut, that he was so healthy.

202
00:16:27,643 --> 00:16:30,768
Uncle Vanya calls him to a duel.

203
00:16:30,768 --> 00:16:33,000
He wants to fight with him.

204
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
So that he is not a thug.

205
00:16:47,345 --> 00:16:51,071
Two months after the first day of the
protests, despite the fights and arrests of

206
00:16:51,096 --> 00:16:56,080
activists, there was a limit that neither
the police nor self-defense could cross.

207
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,158
Human life.

208
00:16:58,158 --> 00:17:01,000
Everything changed after the first death.

209
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
And the resistance turned into a real war.

210
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
We don't throw stones yet.

211
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
And we are trying to push those
who will throw until my command.

212
00:18:19,975 --> 00:18:21,975
To those who see me.

213
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
If something happens to me,

214
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
just know that I`m.

215
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:15,823
Glory to Ukraine!

216
00:19:20,683 --> 00:19:23,340
Freedom to Ukraine!

217
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,933
People are a terrible
force if they are angry.

218
00:20:05,933 --> 00:20:08,000
But while we were holding
back, no one was angry.

219
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,714
No one didn't shoot, we didn't kill them.

220
00:20:09,714 --> 00:20:12,000
Although we could have
killed them in different ways.

221
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,855
If we take anger, when you
don't think about anything,

222
00:20:17,855 --> 00:20:19,730
then of course we would
have killed them very quickly.

223
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:22,667
Only we would have looked
much worse for the whole world.

224
00:20:22,667 --> 00:20:24,620
And we understood that too.

225
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:31,000
Therefore, to say that we were
unarmed, someone used the weapon,

226
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
someone brought it with him to the
Maidan, someone was ready to shoot,

227
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
and someone was shooting, there are
many dead people from the other side too.

228
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,886
But it wasn't the general idea.

229
00:21:09,886 --> 00:21:15,280
One for all and all for one!

230
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
And there was another meeting. 
With whom do you think?

231
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,200
With the front one.

232
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
You must have been tense.

233
00:21:30,024 --> 00:21:32,024
I`m tense.

234
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Not all of those present are aware of some 
of the family peculiarities.

235
00:21:38,024 --> 00:21:40,024
But we'll keep quiet about that. So, ...

236
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
They sent us a carrier pigeon.

237
00:21:45,024 --> 00:21:49,024
Is this the one that 
burned while flying over the barricades?

238
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Cheers, men, to your health. 
Be strong!

239
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:35,761
In a month, during the self-defense shooting
at Instytutskyi, Khan will be badly wounded.

240
00:22:35,761 --> 00:22:38,698
He will receive a few sniper bullets.

241
00:22:38,698 --> 00:22:41,100
His life will be saved by doctors.

242
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:49,100
At the end of the confrontation, the
self-defense forces will count 12,000 people.

243
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:52,100
Almost 100 of them will die.

244
00:22:53,000 --> 00:23:19,600
Winter that changed us.
