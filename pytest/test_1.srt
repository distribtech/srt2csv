1
00:00:04,539 --> 00:00:07,819
Ukraine. Dniester. 2017

2
00:00:07,843 --> 00:00:10,210
Holy Mother of Heroes.

3
00:00:10,235 --> 00:00:12,368
Holy Mother of Heroes.

4
00:00:12,393 --> 00:00:14,523
Come to my heart.

5
00:00:14,547 --> 00:00:15,976
Come to my heart.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Caucasian winds blow in a storm.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Friends, today you will watch an episode that will be different
from all those episodes that were on my channel before.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,217
Because today we are going by an invitation to visit Azov.

9
00:00:50,242 --> 00:00:54,000
And now we are 20 kilometers
away from their combat positions.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,493
We are going by invitation to good friends,
Ilya Samoilenko and Bogdan Krotevych.

11
00:00:59,881 --> 00:01:05,287
Because there is a special occasion.
Ten years since the founding of Azov.

12
00:01:05,609 --> 00:01:09,000
There is a special occasion and there is a tremor, of course.

13
00:01:11,944 --> 00:01:13,944
Apparently, it was a hall.

14
00:01:15,596 --> 00:01:19,752
Because there were obviously places to sit.

15
00:01:19,777 --> 00:01:22,455
A part from the Journey of Onegin.

16
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,143
I lived in Odesa then.

17
00:01:24,168 --> 00:01:25,000
Dusty.

18
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:29,480
Stay here, Alexander Sergeyevich Pushkin.

19
00:01:30,508 --> 00:01:32,000
Russians are scum.

20
00:01:49,562 --> 00:01:53,776
Implementation of the Cold War Plan by the USSR...

21
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:08,566
Please tell us about blood transfusion because
it is talked about as know-how, but it had been prohibited before.

22
00:02:08,591 --> 00:02:12,394
It had been prohibited. There wasn't enough determination.

23
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:15,290
Will is needed everywhere, right?

24
00:02:15,553 --> 00:02:17,837
Grandmothers and grandfathers are sitting there on the benches.

25
00:02:17,862 --> 00:02:20,000
You pass by, they look at you like this and think,

26
00:02:21,151 --> 00:02:22,000
A fascist?

27
00:02:22,498 --> 00:02:23,020
Really?

28
00:02:23,044 --> 00:02:23,716
Yeah.

29
00:02:23,741 --> 00:02:26,217
Why do you constantly troll 
Spartan about age?

30
00:02:26,242 --> 00:02:27,714
No, I'm Spartan, he's Iraq.

31
00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:29,000
Sorry, Iraq.

32
00:02:29,679 --> 00:02:30,679
Because I ...

33
00:02:30,704 --> 00:02:31,904
Because he loves me.

34
00:02:32,727 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm younger.

35
00:02:35,902 --> 00:02:37,127
34.

36
00:02:39,466 --> 00:02:40,646
I'm not younger, but I'm older.

37
00:02:40,671 --> 00:02:42,166
But I'm older and wiser, right?

38
00:02:42,191 --> 00:02:43,000
Yes.

39
00:02:43,525 --> 00:02:45,325
So he doesn't relax.

40
00:02:45,594 --> 00:02:47,137
I understand, but not really.

41
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:51,919
I will still go with it and I will think about your words.

42
00:02:53,478 --> 00:02:56,000
Redis, tell me, what kind of person is he?

43
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:57,519
A standard.

44
00:02:57,544 --> 00:03:00,939
What is the distance between you and him?

45
00:03:02,585 --> 00:03:04,585
So how will this war end?

46
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:12,856
Moseychuk + Azov. Episode 1.
'Irak' and 'Spartan'.

47
00:03:13,978 --> 00:03:19,975
Well, friends, we are in the Serbirian
forestry, our group came here quite early.

48
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
We will stay here until the evening
because we want to see the medical evacuation,

49
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
and how it is arranged in the Azov brigade.

50
00:03:28,545 --> 00:03:35,000
Of course, the location itself, this is
the location of the brigade, is impressive,

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:42,146
because the forest has burned out, a
little further, where the guys are fighting,

52
00:03:42,171 --> 00:03:43,865
it is practically gone.

53
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:50,000
When I compared and googled the Serbirian forestry,

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,696
it showed, you know, such a rich,
very dense, beautiful forest.

55
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:58,676
And now I see tree trunks.

56
00:03:58,701 --> 00:04:04,491
Well, unfortunately, you can't turn the
camera there, where this picture is,

57
00:04:04,516 --> 00:04:08,518
but this is what this forest looks like now,

58
00:04:08,543 --> 00:04:11,806
where the fighting is.

59
00:04:11,831 --> 00:04:15,000
Well, that's where we'll go in the evening.

60
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Explosions are raging here, and we hear them.

61
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,563
I can't say that it's very scary,

62
00:04:22,588 --> 00:04:33,000
maybe this wave of courage is
radiating from our Azov soldiers who are here.

63
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,705
All these guys are saying, they
are tired after the combat missions,

64
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:40,339
they are sleepless.

65
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:48,840
But they agreed to these talks, they came to these interviews.

66
00:04:49,862 --> 00:04:52,000
A huge thank you to them for this.

67
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,687
But all these words that you hear from
them, you know, they are so significant,

68
00:04:57,712 --> 00:05:01,669
they are so true, and they are very honest.

69
00:05:01,694 --> 00:05:08,000
We talked about different things, we talked about
life, military life, and survival in general, as they say.

70
00:05:08,097 --> 00:05:12,736
About the military ethics, about the needs of the Azov regiment,

71
00:05:12,761 --> 00:05:17,761
about how the Armed Forces of Ukraine should be reconstructed,

72
00:05:19,122 --> 00:05:24,000
about vertical and horizontal management and subordination.

73
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:32,445
In a word, good conversations with the right people.

74
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,199
Once again?

75
00:05:48,743 --> 00:05:52,000
If you have seen these conversations,
then you know what it means.

76
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Yes.

77
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,335
It means the beginning.

78
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Natalia.

79
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Spartan.

80
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,806
Natalia.

81
00:05:58,831 --> 00:05:59,870
Iraq.

82
00:06:00,128 --> 00:06:01,441
Why Iraq?

83
00:06:02,393 --> 00:06:06,689
I, perhaps, will firstly answer this question.

84
00:06:06,714 --> 00:06:12,281
Before that, I already had the practice of small interviews.

85
00:06:12,306 --> 00:06:18,488
I have always responded that I do not discuss this topic.

86
00:06:18,513 --> 00:06:20,000
It is personal for me.

87
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:22,000
Well, I'll put it this way.

88
00:06:22,025 --> 00:06:36,647
In short, Iraq because it is a power, a strength,
it is a constant thirst for self-reliance,

89
00:06:37,321 --> 00:06:39,798
and it is a country of the male race.

90
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
That's all about this topic.

91
00:06:43,324 --> 00:06:45,000
When did you come up with such a pseudo?

92
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,163
Well, it was before Azov.

93
00:06:47,188 --> 00:06:48,610
It was before Azov.

94
00:06:48,635 --> 00:06:52,659
And in Azov, let's say, I have already put it to work.

95
00:06:52,684 --> 00:06:53,684
I see.

96
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Spartan, is it from a character or from a fighting vehicle?

97
00:07:00,245 --> 00:07:02,000
No, I have a tattoo.

98
00:07:02,233 --> 00:07:04,000
I did it in 2019.

99
00:07:04,482 --> 00:07:17,608
And when I was at BITC, I went out in the morning from the
bathroom without a T-shirt, without anything, only pants.

100
00:07:17,633 --> 00:07:24,070
Our instructor saw me, saw the tattoo, and he called me that.

101
00:07:24,095 --> 00:07:25,520
Well, he said without a second thought.

102
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,940
Spartan. That's all.

103
00:07:28,024 --> 00:07:28,523
Yes.

104
00:07:28,557 --> 00:07:30,696
Why are you insecure about your Ukrainian?

105
00:07:31,821 --> 00:07:33,252
You have good Ukrainian.

106
00:07:33,277 --> 00:07:34,000
Yes.

107
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,195
Well, I've got into character already.

108
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,400
We are trying.

109
00:07:36,474 --> 00:07:37,500
Where are you from?

110
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,572
Dnipro.

111
00:07:38,597 --> 00:07:39,650
From Dnipro.

112
00:07:39,675 --> 00:07:40,956
And you?

113
00:07:40,981 --> 00:07:42,866
I'm from the Donetsk region.

114
00:07:42,991 --> 00:07:44,691
Donetsk region.

115
00:07:45,075 --> 00:07:46,212
Is this part occupied now?

116
00:07:46,737 --> 00:07:48,000
No, thank God, not yet.

117
00:07:48,315 --> 00:07:50,187
Well, I hope it won't be.

118
00:07:51,107 --> 00:07:55,889
Well, we will put in as much effort
as possible so that it does not happen.

119
00:07:56,563 --> 00:07:58,960
When did you come to Azov?

120
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:01,000
In 2022.

121
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
At the end, somewhere.

122
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,190
In October.

123
00:08:04,215 --> 00:08:05,700
We came together.

124
00:08:05,748 --> 00:08:07,000
In October at the same time.

125
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Did you know each other before that?

126
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Yes.

127
00:08:09,034 --> 00:08:10,034
Were you friends before that?

128
00:08:10,059 --> 00:08:11,059
Yes.

129
00:08:11,462 --> 00:08:12,462
Where did you meet?

130
00:08:12,647 --> 00:08:13,192
We ...

131
00:08:13,517 --> 00:08:14,517
In the police.

132
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,293
Did you both serve?

133
00:08:16,318 --> 00:08:18,248
Yes, we served in one unit.

134
00:08:18,273 --> 00:08:26,975
This is a special police unit, which, well,
has the function of performing force support

135
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,576
of the police,

136
00:08:28,601 --> 00:08:38,134
ensuring force support of public mass events, security of the public order,

137
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,630
and support in the conduct of investigations.

138
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,296
Well, in general, force support.

139
00:08:46,769 --> 00:08:48,058
Well, did you work in Dnipro?

140
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:48,717
Yes.

141
00:08:48,742 --> 00:08:50,442
Both of you in Dnipro?

142
00:08:50,495 --> 00:08:54,798
How did the decision to go to Azov emerge?

143
00:08:54,823 --> 00:08:55,856
Why Azov?

144
00:08:56,181 --> 00:08:58,233
I have my own reasons, let Spartan talk.

145
00:08:58,258 --> 00:09:11,364
When it was in March, at the beginning of
March, we had such great excitement.

146
00:09:12,961 --> 00:09:19,000
And when there was already an understanding that Mariupol
was already surrounded, and the guys needed help.

147
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:28,000
At that time, there were also police units, and this issue
of the unblocking came up, and we tried to get there.

148
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:39,000
We came to our management and asked, they said no, you can't.

149
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:49,000
We began to look for other corridors to get
there and even considered leaving the job.

150
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,000
We wanted to leave if we were not allowed to leave by
transfer, although Azov belongs to the National Guard,

151
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
the National Guard belongs to the MIA.

152
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,515
We were also in the ranks of the MIA.

153
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:01,433
I didn't understand why.

154
00:10:02,148 --> 00:10:04,000
We really wanted to help.

155
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:07,000
Did you have friends there?

156
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I personally had two of... well,
I can't say that they're my friends.

157
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,280
These guys were from my city, I knew them personally.

158
00:10:23,184 --> 00:10:26,318
One of them is still in captivity, unfortunately.

159
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,318
One of them returned during the first exchange.

160
00:10:34,417 --> 00:10:42,517
Just the understanding that the guys needed help,
and at that moment they were in a very difficult state.

161
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:52,443
I just wanted to help, I wanted to do something, because at that
moment we were in Dnipro, and there were no active hostilities there.

162
00:10:52,468 --> 00:10:57,975
There were shelling, there were saboteurs and so on.

163
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,454
I really wanted to help with something.

164
00:10:59,479 --> 00:11:09,575
Plus, you know, it also affected me that
everything was going on in my motherland.

165
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,600
And I couldn't help right now.

166
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,697
Then, we decided.

167
00:11:17,722 --> 00:11:20,239
It was just problematic to get there.

168
00:11:20,264 --> 00:11:21,040
To join there.

169
00:11:21,065 --> 00:11:24,975
When it was September,

170
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:34,587
we saw that there was the first recruitment
after Azovstal for the BITC in Azov.

171
00:11:34,642 --> 00:11:35,642
And that's it.

172
00:11:35,667 --> 00:11:37,419
We submitted the application right away.

173
00:11:37,444 --> 00:11:38,667
We went to the interview.

174
00:11:38,692 --> 00:11:41,166
Then we took a vacation

175
00:11:41,405 --> 00:11:43,405
and went to the BITC.

176
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:49,975
Still being policemen, we went
on vacation in order to qualify in Azov.

177
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,473
Yes.

178
00:11:50,498 --> 00:11:52,000
Then, after the vacation...

179
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
With whom did you talk in Azov?

180
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:55,819
Did Krotevych select?

181
00:11:55,844 --> 00:11:57,355
No.

182
00:11:58,776 --> 00:12:07,776
Well, before that, there were two attempts for us to
join the then Special Operations Detachment Azov.

183
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,398
We wrote to the Recruiting Center that we
want to get to the unblocking of Mariupol.

184
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
We were told that we were active policemen

185
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,565
and the transfer was not possible.

186
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Then, I wrote,

187
00:12:23,775 --> 00:12:25,000
we will quit.

188
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,748
Will you take us as civilians?

189
00:12:29,871 --> 00:12:30,913
I wrote.

190
00:12:30,938 --> 00:12:32,938
Then he wrote from his phone.

191
00:12:32,963 --> 00:12:40,963
For the third time, when we wrote there,
they already associated us, roughly speaking.

192
00:12:40,988 --> 00:12:43,831
They write to him, you are probably friends.

193
00:12:44,315 --> 00:12:46,546
This one and that one.
You are probably friends.

194
00:12:46,571 --> 00:12:47,923
Fine.

195
00:12:48,515 --> 00:12:52,253
You won't get to the unblocking.

196
00:12:52,278 --> 00:12:57,918
But if you want to go to Azov, go and prove it at the BITC.

197
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:02,346
We got to the first BITC after a full-scale invasion.

198
00:13:02,371 --> 00:13:03,975
Explain the BITC term to the viewers.

199
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,114
Basic Initial Training Course.

200
00:13:07,337 --> 00:13:10,850
Endurance, physical abilities, stamina course.

201
00:13:10,889 --> 00:13:14,000
It is difficult.

202
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,735
In means, they don't accept easily to Azov?

203
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,000
No.

204
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It's not possible.

205
00:13:24,408 --> 00:13:26,000
Which exams should you pass?

206
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,915
It used to be called Physical Education.

207
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:28,777
Yes.

208
00:13:28,802 --> 00:13:36,000
There are Physical Education, and stress resistance, and
medicine, and fire training, you have to know everything.

209
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:45,864
Everyone is prepared for the hardest, for the infantry.

210
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:51,690
We were told in order to be an infantryman,
you need to be able to do everything,

211
00:13:51,905 --> 00:14:02,841
you need to be physically hardy, morally
strong, able to make difficult decisions,

212
00:14:03,197 --> 00:14:13,556
you need to develop critical thinking very much and then show
it in practice because you can't relax being an infantryman.

213
00:14:14,421 --> 00:14:19,746
Everyone is preparing for infantry, and then someone
can, for example, become a machine gunner, am I right?

214
00:14:19,771 --> 00:14:22,526
A machine gunner is also an infantryman.

215
00:14:22,551 --> 00:14:26,000
Okay, and then which position can you take after an infantry?

216
00:14:26,025 --> 00:14:31,184
Yes, then you can try in artillery or as a drone operator.

217
00:14:31,442 --> 00:14:38,000
Now I don't know, I won't tell you exactly, but
when I went to Azov, the sergeant told me,

218
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
you have to serve in the infantry for a year, and only
then you can ask questions about transportation,

219
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
for example, in artillery, or somewhere else.

220
00:14:48,027 --> 00:14:50,545
Like, you have to look at this war
with the eyes of an infantryman.

221
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:52,108
Have you ever regretted it?

222
00:14:52,133 --> 00:14:53,000
No.

223
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:54,631
Well, I don't want to...

224
00:14:54,656 --> 00:14:58,503
In general, I didn't care.

225
00:15:00,396 --> 00:15:05,000
By the way, I was a senior lieutenant in the police,

226
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:11,000
and they told me during the interview in the recruiting center,

227
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,380
why?

228
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:14,122
Why are you doing this?

229
00:15:14,147 --> 00:15:19,131
After the war, no one will tell you a word that you laid low.

230
00:15:19,533 --> 00:15:22,417
You had your own job, you had your own business.

231
00:15:23,036 --> 00:15:28,687
Well, I think that I would not have
done enough if I had been a policeman.

232
00:15:29,335 --> 00:15:34,865
Well, this is only my choice, I
don't impose it on anyone, so to speak.

233
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:39,223
I became a soldier, that's it, I became a soldier.

234
00:15:40,128 --> 00:15:41,388
That is, you are now a Private.

235
00:15:41,413 --> 00:15:41,933
No.

236
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:44,000
We are already officers.

237
00:15:45,231 --> 00:15:46,571
What rank?

238
00:15:46,596 --> 00:15:48,000
I am a lieutenant.

239
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I am a junior lieutenant.

240
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
You are a junior lieutenant.

241
00:15:50,288 --> 00:15:51,288
That is, you catching up quickly.

242
00:15:51,313 --> 00:15:56,000
I was just in the position of the chief sergeant of the platoon,

243
00:15:56,601 --> 00:15:59,893
and then I was appointed commander of the platoon,

244
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:04,000
and I was in charge of the duties of the commander of the platoon.

245
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Why do you constantly troll Spartan about his age?

246
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,100
No, I'm Spartan, it's Iraq.

247
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,200
Sorry, Iraq.

248
00:16:11,265 --> 00:16:12,700
Because he loves me, I'm sure.

249
00:16:12,755 --> 00:16:14,552
Well, I'm younger.

250
00:16:16,711 --> 00:16:18,675
I have more ambitions.

251
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,816
I'm not younger, but I'm older.

252
00:16:20,841 --> 00:16:22,605
But I'm older and wiser, right?

253
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:23,630
Yes, I think so.

254
00:16:23,655 --> 00:16:24,895
So that he doesn't relax.

255
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,920
I see.

256
00:16:26,396 --> 00:16:30,396
Now you are choosing personnel,
as far as I understand, right?

257
00:16:30,421 --> 00:16:33,421
As far as it is possible to say, yes.

258
00:16:34,381 --> 00:16:39,381
We have already been on interviews many times, and yes, yes.

259
00:16:39,793 --> 00:16:44,574
Is it more difficult to be a Private
than to be a commander, or vice versa?

260
00:16:44,599 --> 00:16:52,000
It's easier to be a private because, well,
let's say, you will be given instructions,

261
00:16:52,025 --> 00:16:58,493
you have already had been thought about, but,
well, we are the same soldiers to our leadership.

262
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:01,248
We are also given instructions, we carry out orders.

263
00:17:03,888 --> 00:17:10,020
Well, I would be much calmer if I were a simple soldier.

264
00:17:10,045 --> 00:17:17,975
Well, because I am constantly worried
when they give us some tasks,

265
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,109
and in general, for the personnel, well, all
commanders are worried about personnel.

266
00:17:23,134 --> 00:17:25,497
We just came from the same Basic Combat Training together.

267
00:17:25,522 --> 00:17:31,601
The guys and I, together on this course pushed the
soil, then they put me as their commander,

268
00:17:31,626 --> 00:17:33,626
and I'm like, damn it.

269
00:17:33,651 --> 00:17:39,313
Well, after two years, there are such close
relations, and, well, this is already a family.

270
00:17:40,138 --> 00:17:43,321
That is, the family that is at home is a
family, and here, here is your family.

271
00:17:43,346 --> 00:17:52,521
And when you make a decision or give
them some task, then, I don't know,

272
00:17:52,776 --> 00:17:57,109
you think five hundred times, everything is
like this, so that everything goes good there.

273
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,000
They tell me that Iraq and Spartan
are very effective commanders, right?

274
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,085
What is the efficiency of the Azov?

275
00:18:07,685 --> 00:18:18,651
Well, first of all, for the Azovs, for any
military, the main goal is to perform a combat task

276
00:18:18,676 --> 00:18:20,292
and to preserve the personnel.

277
00:18:20,871 --> 00:18:29,450
You, before giving orders to the soldiers,
you have to understand that you give orders

278
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:37,975
not just to the soldiers, you give it to the life,
you give it to the life of their wives after this,

279
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:45,000
and you give it to the life of the parents
after your wrong order, well, incompetent.

280
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:56,000
You have to think five hundred times and make
a decision that will lead to effective performance

281
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,493
and preservation of your personnel.

282
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Well, for me personally, this is priority number one.

283
00:19:02,025 --> 00:19:07,548
So that the guys go and return alive, healthy, and well.

284
00:19:07,573 --> 00:19:12,000
Because it is very difficult when there are losses in the unit.

285
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Well, for me personally, it is very difficult
to meet with the parents, with the wives,

286
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
with the sisters of our guys who died there.

287
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Well, to explain all this to them, they ask how it was, and why so.

288
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Whether you like it or not, when you communicate like this, you ...

289
00:19:37,624 --> 00:19:40,624
consider yourself to be guilty anyway.

290
00:19:40,649 --> 00:19:44,138
Well, even though it may not...

291
00:19:44,454 --> 00:19:45,976
It all may not depend on you.

292
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
...not depend on you, but I have such a constant feeling.

293
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:56,251
And when ... Well, this is my biggest fear.

294
00:19:57,387 --> 00:20:01,496
When all these conversations, when it happens,

295
00:20:01,521 --> 00:20:05,000
when it needs to be explained, to go to farewell, to look at it all,

296
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
when the parents ...

297
00:20:06,684 --> 00:20:09,975
wife, parents are crying there, and you stand there and think,

298
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,415
damn, somewhere here it was my shortcoming.

299
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,975
Did I do everything to prevent it?

300
00:20:19,012 --> 00:20:23,000
Even if you did everything, you still look for it.

301
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Well, you know, I think it's better to be like that,

302
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
it's better to be worried about it than to just say,

303
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
go ahead, go ahead, pick a spot.

304
00:20:32,964 --> 00:20:36,975
You have to think about it, you have to constantly consider it.

305
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Because when you are with the guys, you are there, next to them,

306
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
when you see what they feel, what they see,

307
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,363
how it all goes around,

308
00:20:53,102 --> 00:20:57,000
only after that you already understand
how to do it the right way, what is right.

309
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,475
Because you look not only from the command line,

310
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:03,658
but you also see with the eyes of a soldier how he will do it,

311
00:21:03,683 --> 00:21:06,762
and in general, whether he will be able to do it.

312
00:21:06,787 --> 00:21:12,362
Because for them, in our unit, especially for infantrymen,

313
00:21:12,387 --> 00:21:18,243
we try to create the most comfortable
conditions during the combat mission

314
00:21:18,268 --> 00:21:23,025
so that they come in and show their skills.

315
00:21:43,009 --> 00:21:46,332
Three hours later.
Stabilization point

316
00:21:46,357 --> 00:21:47,463
Greetings.

317
00:21:47,488 --> 00:21:48,631
Natalia.

318
00:21:48,656 --> 00:21:52,607
Greetings.

319
00:21:53,383 --> 00:21:54,848
Drama. hello.

320
00:21:54,872 --> 00:21:57,374
One minute, I`m eating vitamins.

321
00:21:58,805 --> 00:22:00,579
Here we are with the shootings.

322
00:22:00,604 --> 00:22:02,149
Greetings.

323
00:22:02,174 --> 00:22:03,181
Did you recognize?

324
00:22:03,206 --> 00:22:06,777
I saw you somewhere. There was a small screen, like this.

325
00:22:06,802 --> 00:22:07,680
I don't remember where.

326
00:22:07,705 --> 00:22:09,000
Hello, my friend.

327
00:22:09,476 --> 00:22:10,476
What's your name?

328
00:22:10,501 --> 00:22:11,501
Trauma.

329
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,000
That's it. Trauma.

330
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Oleksandr.

331
00:22:18,108 --> 00:22:20,436
Mr. Oleksandr. How long have
 you been Trauma?

332
00:22:21,829 --> 00:22:23,329
Since the beginning of the full-scale invasion.

333
00:22:23,354 --> 00:22:25,000
I was in the territorial defense at first.

334
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
They were already giving out, well,
 not giving out, but choosing nicknames.

335
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,531
Well, since I am an orthopedic traumatologist
according to my civil specialty,

336
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,255
it has clung this way.

337
00:22:35,286 --> 00:22:36,489
Where did you work as a traumatologist?

338
00:22:36,714 --> 00:22:37,987
In Kremenchuk.

339
00:22:38,012 --> 00:22:39,303
How did you end up in Azov?

340
00:22:39,521 --> 00:22:42,556
At first, I was in the 145th Battalion of the 116th Brigade.

341
00:22:42,581 --> 00:22:44,185
This is the Poltava region.

342
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:46,000
I was near Bakhmut.

343
00:22:48,402 --> 00:22:50,975
Then I was in Kurakhove, the last zone.

344
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,930
When I was still there, I applied through the recruitment center.

345
00:22:55,955 --> 00:22:58,000
Here is such an ageism, look.

346
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
They push with their elbows and say, oh, you are already 36.

347
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,405
Already 36.

348
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:03,510
Yeah.

349
00:23:03,761 --> 00:23:07,216
There is a biological age, and there is a psychological age.

350
00:23:07,241 --> 00:23:09,282
I have a psychological age of 30-32.

351
00:23:09,307 --> 00:23:10,580
Oh, I see.

352
00:23:10,605 --> 00:23:12,221
Yes, you can show off, of course.

353
00:23:12,246 --> 00:23:13,246
Well, that's the situation.

354
00:23:13,613 --> 00:23:14,374
I see.

355
00:23:14,399 --> 00:23:17,000
This is a dug-out in the ground.

356
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,620
Dug out.

357
00:23:17,645 --> 00:23:24,426
It is calculated so that the distance to the largest
combat zone is three and a half kilometers.

358
00:23:24,451 --> 00:23:25,000
Three and a half?

359
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,500
Three and a half kilometers.

360
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:30,200
We often hear the cannonade and the shootout.

361
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,500
There are strikes here sometimes.

362
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,908
So, if you stay a little longer, you can...

363
00:23:34,941 --> 00:23:41,635
You can see the results, the ground 
is shaking here.

364
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,270
Yes.

365
00:23:42,468 --> 00:23:45,468
Listen, Mr. Oleksandr, you say that you are a traumatologist.

366
00:23:45,738 --> 00:23:49,340
Well, I understand that an injury is not a fracture.

367
00:23:50,950 --> 00:24:00,235
As a rule, if there is General Physical Training, and it is not my
first day in medicine, then I have already gone through a lot.

368
00:24:00,904 --> 00:24:06,904
That is, working in district hospitals,
 in city hospitals, so I already saw it.

369
00:24:06,929 --> 00:24:13,929
Plus, working with other teams, for example, in
Kurakhove, there was a surgical transfer group...

370
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:21,000
a surgical group where surgeons worked, and
there was also an oncologist in that group,

371
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:27,000
who also worked as a surgeon, so we
know what to do in all surgical professions.

372
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
The question of experience and the question
of something else are separate issues.

373
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,649
And the guys with you, what do they do?

374
00:24:31,674 --> 00:24:32,571
Anesthesiologist.

375
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,480
Anesthesiologist. What's your name?

376
00:24:35,705 --> 00:24:37,305
My name is Mikhailo.

377
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:38,000
Nice to meet you.

378
00:24:38,024 --> 00:24:38,748
Likewise.

379
00:24:38,772 --> 00:24:40,673
And you have another assistant.

380
00:24:40,761 --> 00:24:41,761
Felsher.

381
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,693
Felsher.

382
00:24:42,718 --> 00:24:44,432
You are Felsher. What's your name?

383
00:24:44,457 --> 00:24:45,782
Zhenya.

384
00:24:45,807 --> 00:24:47,000
Mr. Yevhen, nice to meet you.

385
00:24:48,486 --> 00:24:50,300
You haven't had any patients today, have you?

386
00:24:50,325 --> 00:24:52,648
What do you mean? We already had five people.

387
00:24:52,673 --> 00:24:53,570
You just missed each other.

388
00:24:53,595 --> 00:24:55,308
Did you have any serious injuries today?

389
00:24:56,323 --> 00:24:59,884
I wouldn't say serious, but problematic.

390
00:25:00,694 --> 00:25:03,000
In any case, you need to control these things.

391
00:25:03,337 --> 00:25:08,500
Now he is yellow, and on the road he can be black or red.

392
00:25:08,695 --> 00:25:11,596
It's better to look closely, it's better to control.

393
00:25:12,823 --> 00:25:15,136
Where did the guys go just now from you?

394
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:16,218
Slavyansk.

395
00:25:16,343 --> 00:25:17,343
Slavyansk.

396
00:25:20,892 --> 00:25:27,126
Please tell us about blood transfusion,
because it is talked about as a know-how which...

397
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:29,200
First of all, it is necessary.

398
00:25:29,225 --> 00:25:31,000
Yes, which is simply necessary now.

399
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,371
Because blood flow is critical.

400
00:25:33,396 --> 00:25:35,813
Before, blood transfusion was prohibited in the trenches.

401
00:25:35,838 --> 00:25:40,000
Not that it was strictly prohibited, there was no resolution.

402
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,978
Resolution.

403
00:25:41,003 --> 00:25:43,027
You need strong will everywhere, right?

404
00:25:43,052 --> 00:25:48,845
Well, you have to be brave enough to do it.

405
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:50,000
Well, to do it.

406
00:25:50,513 --> 00:25:55,000
Because now, I say it again, he can be yellow or half-red.

407
00:25:56,907 --> 00:25:58,000
Blood loss.

408
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
While they're driving, we can lose a person.

409
00:26:02,298 --> 00:26:07,447
One of the causes of death is blood loss.

410
00:26:07,472 --> 00:26:09,342
You do blood transfusions, don't you?

411
00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:11,282
It's better to ask an anesthesiologist.

412
00:26:11,307 --> 00:26:13,000
Because I work with my hands.

413
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Was there a blood transfusion today?

414
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:21,000
We haven't had it, but the transfusion
was done by our combat medics before our stage.

415
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:23,000
They have already poured a unit of blood.

416
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,755
That is, the patient came to us.

417
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,000
Right there, on the spot?

418
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Yes.

419
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
It's critical.

420
00:26:29,351 --> 00:26:31,000
You just have to do it all.

421
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,500
It's technically not difficult.

422
00:26:32,516 --> 00:26:33,957
You have the right equipment.

423
00:26:33,982 --> 00:26:35,300
Why be afraid?

424
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:36,500
There is a question...

425
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
No, just like that...

426
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Some people are just afraid.

427
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Even when I imagine, for example, in
a trench, on the ground, and a medic can do it?

428
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:53,000
A medic who is in a trench, has no blood with him, because he
needs to carry a refrigerator with him, and it is quite difficult.

429
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
He is both a combat unit and a combat medic.

430
00:26:56,923 --> 00:27:02,201
Therefore, it is difficult to combine a combat backpack,
a medic's backpack, and a refrigerator.

431
00:27:02,226 --> 00:27:08,630
But at a certain distance from the
front edge, that is, at a very short distance,

432
00:27:08,654 --> 00:27:14,968
so that the soldier could be delivered there as quickly as
possible, there is already a certain place, a certain lodge,

433
00:27:15,678 --> 00:27:25,522
where there are experienced combat medics who master
these methods, who are well-educated and well-educated.

434
00:27:25,547 --> 00:27:30,554
They understand what they are doing when they
 are doing it, and what they are doing it for.

435
00:27:30,579 --> 00:27:38,426
They bring the wounded to this sorting point
where he is examined, given first aid,

436
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:44,455
and, in particular, if there is a need for
blood transfusion or plasma, it is carried out there.

437
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,000
Where are you from?

438
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,800
I am from Dnipro.

439
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:52,164
There I spent, probably ...

440
00:27:52,189 --> 00:27:53,679
What hospital did work in?

441
00:27:53,704 --> 00:27:55,220
In the regional children's hospital.

442
00:27:55,245 --> 00:27:56,035
Really?

443
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,940
I am a children's doctor-anesthesiologist, yes.

444
00:27:57,973 --> 00:28:01,995
The school of superheroes has opened there,
in the oncology department, maybe you know.

445
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,000
Yes, I know.

446
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,299
You can say hello to your colleagues, children.

447
00:28:06,324 --> 00:28:13,296
Hello to everyone, children, I hope they
have all signed out, and all colleagues, hello.

448
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
This is an opportunity to thank them.

449
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Yes.

450
00:28:20,459 --> 00:28:23,724
Sometimes happens that, I'll say a little pessimistically,

451
00:28:23,749 --> 00:28:30,623
as an orthopedic traumatologist, the boys are seeking help
with diseases of the musculoskeletal system from me.

452
00:28:30,648 --> 00:28:33,000
In particular, the spine, in particular, the knee.

453
00:28:33,288 --> 00:28:35,522
Well, wear combat gear, wear armor, wear a helmet.

454
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:38,000
Hernia, protrusions, meniscus.

455
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,027
When you are treating them, it gets better.

456
00:28:42,052 --> 00:28:43,975
That is, the boys are satisfied, then they are brought here.

457
00:28:44,526 --> 00:28:46,000
Sometimes they are dead.

458
00:28:48,904 --> 00:28:50,843
They have become better, they are satisfied.

459
00:28:50,868 --> 00:28:53,835
I already tell them what sanatorium they'll go to.

460
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,663
And then they are brought here dead.

461
00:28:55,966 --> 00:28:57,900
It's a pity.

462
00:28:58,783 --> 00:29:00,000
This situation.

463
00:29:04,721 --> 00:29:09,721
The intensive care ward has absolutely everything at a minimum.

464
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:13,070
Here we have wrapped blankets for the patient.

465
00:29:19,516 --> 00:29:20,516
So that it does not get wet.

466
00:29:20,541 --> 00:29:21,970
So that it can be wiped.

467
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:24,000
And at the same time, the heater is turned on.

468
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,000
This warmth is very critically important for our patients.

469
00:29:30,468 --> 00:29:34,913
Artificial lung ventilation device, patient monitor, aspirator.

470
00:29:34,938 --> 00:29:37,938
Well, it is portable.

471
00:29:38,483 --> 00:29:44,000
You can use a portable artificial lung
ventilation device as well as a stationary.

472
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Plus there is an oxygen concentrator.

473
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Here we have a system for heating blood.

474
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,190
This is what gives us the opportunity to infuse the blood quickly.

475
00:29:57,411 --> 00:29:59,708
To conduct a transfusion.

476
00:29:59,733 --> 00:30:04,000
That is, it will be the temperature of thirty-nine degrees.

477
00:30:04,314 --> 00:30:05,441
Is it a picture?

478
00:30:05,475 --> 00:30:12,317
In this navigation, we need to
evaluate whether there is internal bleeding.

479
00:30:12,342 --> 00:30:14,905
This is intrapleural hemorrhage, 
intra-abdominal hemorrhage.

480
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:16,840
Is there pneumothorax or not?

481
00:30:16,865 --> 00:30:20,465
If there is, we need to be 
able to address the issue.

482
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
We use an ultrasound machine.

483
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,445
That is, we have an intensive therapy room here.

484
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,246
It is called a transformer with extended authority.

485
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:31,305
Absolutely in full capacity.

486
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,000
Trained?

487
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,525
Trained, yes.

488
00:30:34,185 --> 00:30:37,000
Did you help the enemies, save the enemies?

489
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Let's not say 'saved,' but helped.

490
00:30:43,306 --> 00:30:44,410
There were such cases.

491
00:30:44,972 --> 00:30:46,712
Well, was one interesting patient.

492
00:30:46,737 --> 00:30:52,000
Altai region. Prisoner. Were kept in prison for two murders.

493
00:30:52,781 --> 00:30:55,167
I liked to talk to him.

494
00:30:55,199 --> 00:30:57,783
You, banderivtsi are all killers here.

495
00:30:57,808 --> 00:31:00,833
You all need to be...

496
00:31:00,865 --> 00:31:04,580
Well, he talked this nonsense that is called propaganda.

497
00:31:04,605 --> 00:31:05,605
Propaganda.

498
00:31:06,761 --> 00:31:11,670
I don't know how people talk to them in chat roulette.

499
00:31:13,337 --> 00:31:15,000
Well, they cannot set them right.

500
00:31:15,643 --> 00:31:17,000
How long does the shift last?

501
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Three days.

502
00:31:18,889 --> 00:31:19,889
Three-day shift?

503
00:31:19,914 --> 00:31:20,950
Three days.

504
00:31:20,975 --> 00:31:24,311
Then one or two days of sleep and the beginning of another shift.

505
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:28,175
I imagine when you go into civilian life you will say,

506
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:33,975
I was on the front line for three days and you will
be able to as a doctor. When you become a chief.

507
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,000
When you come home to civilian life, for example, to Kremenchuk, and there is all the light, people walk.

508
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,681
And you came from a place where
the light is not turned on at night.

509
00:31:43,706 --> 00:31:45,000
At night, yes.

510
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
And there people walk with children.

511
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:48,556
There is a light.

512
00:31:50,088 --> 00:31:51,144
A contrast.

513
00:31:51,888 --> 00:31:55,224
I wish you not to have patients.

514
00:31:56,057 --> 00:32:00,042
Thank you.

515
00:32:00,067 --> 00:32:01,655
I wish you to have only the little ones.

516
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,679
I wish everything ends fine.

517
00:32:04,765 --> 00:32:06,322
Thank you.

518
00:32:06,347 --> 00:32:08,072
Thank you, Mr. Yevhen.

519
00:32:09,707 --> 00:32:11,099
Good luck.

520
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,470
Good luck.

521
00:32:14,494 --> 00:32:15,667
Goodbye.

522
00:32:26,231 --> 00:32:28,000
What did you come out here?

523
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
We would not like to interfere, Natalia.

524
00:32:31,721 --> 00:32:33,000
Be careful.

525
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
No, no, I remember the order.

526
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
It's a checkpoint there.

527
00:32:37,449 --> 00:32:42,000
I'm afraid to raise such a topic. I raise it, I ...

528
00:32:43,254 --> 00:32:45,637
It always gives me a lot of trouble.

529
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:55,975
I asked both Zelensky and Budanov how to look into the
eyes of the parents when you give awards, for example.

530
00:32:56,398 --> 00:33:02,402
Well, I see that everyone becomes
human when they answer this question.

531
00:33:03,991 --> 00:33:06,000
Just people, without camouflage.

532
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Yes.

533
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,637
They become naked people.

534
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:13,467
Because, you know, it's hard.

535
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:15,000
Hard, very hard.

536
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:28,861
It's hard because, you know, when we
lose our precious soldiers, it's eating me up inside.

537
00:33:28,886 --> 00:33:33,000
I mean, why does it happen?

538
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:44,000
If these people have to build this country,
and these people are our nation?

539
00:33:44,357 --> 00:33:46,357
Well, someone ...

540
00:33:47,482 --> 00:33:56,000
I believe that the nation is those who do something for
their country so that we can win with any of our efforts.

541
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Those who did not lift a finger are just people.

542
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,401
Just people.

543
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,600
I understand what you mean, yes.

544
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,228
When such a time passes ...

545
00:34:06,253 --> 00:34:09,534
I also ask this question. What is the
difference between a nation and a people?

546
00:34:09,559 --> 00:34:13,539
People, guys, they lose their health.

547
00:34:13,564 --> 00:34:15,000
They are there ...

548
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Someone can ...

549
00:34:17,677 --> 00:34:20,339
Well, someone performs a combat mission, and he ...

550
00:34:20,859 --> 00:34:24,384
He has injuries that prevent him from continuing to serve.

551
00:34:24,409 --> 00:34:26,000
Someone died there.

552
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,347
You understand that there will hardly be such people anymore.

553
00:34:29,372 --> 00:34:30,600
Unfortunately.

554
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,776
Unfortunately.

555
00:34:31,901 --> 00:34:33,300
Because all those who ...

556
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,900
Who had such ambitions.

557
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,193
To dedicate oneself.

558
00:34:36,226 --> 00:34:42,975
To dedicate oneself to the unit, to the nation.
Dedicate yourself completely to your brother-in-arms.

559
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,304
Now, unfortunately, they are already ...

560
00:34:45,329 --> 00:34:46,488
They are not with us.

561
00:34:46,513 --> 00:34:47,513
As we see, yes.

562
00:34:48,269 --> 00:34:49,820
These people are not with us.

563
00:34:50,975 --> 00:34:55,208
Well, there are already a lot of people like that
died, or they are, you know, physically limited.

564
00:34:57,428 --> 00:35:02,000
New such warriors are not very eager to go.

565
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:03,843
What happened to your leg?

566
00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:05,000
With mine?

567
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,718
Uh-huh.

568
00:35:05,758 --> 00:35:09,789
Well, nothing. Just a
little ligament. That's all.

569
00:35:09,814 --> 00:35:10,526
Really?

570
00:35:10,551 --> 00:35:11,399
Yes.

571
00:35:14,541 --> 00:35:15,265
Is he lying?

572
00:35:15,289 --> 00:35:16,876
It is all true.

573
00:35:18,589 --> 00:35:22,302
The war two years ago and the war now.

574
00:35:24,785 --> 00:35:25,831
It's different.

575
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:33,124
The enemy is also making conclusions.

576
00:35:33,795 --> 00:35:35,555
Trying to improve.

577
00:35:38,415 --> 00:35:40,146
Not standing still.

578
00:35:40,208 --> 00:35:51,598
Tell me... I'm sorry for the formulation, is there now
a tough technical war, without hatred towards them?

579
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,988
Well, like in the computer game?

580
00:35:54,013 --> 00:35:55,277
Just killing or ...

581
00:35:55,302 --> 00:35:56,302
I will speak for myself.

582
00:35:56,326 --> 00:35:57,976
or do you hate them?

583
00:35:59,385 --> 00:36:01,385
Well, hatred...

584
00:36:04,466 --> 00:36:14,496
I just have to do it, and do it, and keep doing
it as long as I have enough strength and health.

585
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
I just do it.

586
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,916
Hate? Well, and there is hate, yes.

587
00:36:17,941 --> 00:36:19,689
Why? I don't know...

588
00:36:19,714 --> 00:36:29,000
My parents worked faithfully hard to
earn money, built a house, acquired something.

589
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:34,873
At any moment, a rocket can just fly into
my house, and that's it, it won't be there.

590
00:36:34,898 --> 00:36:38,000
I have a father from the Donetsk region,

591
00:36:38,521 --> 00:36:43,000
and my grandparents are buried there,
in the Donetsk region.

592
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I can't just go to their cemetery,
because someone came to liberate that land.

593
00:36:54,729 --> 00:36:59,822
I have enough motivation, and
it won't cease for a very long time.

594
00:36:59,847 --> 00:37:02,483
There will be as much as it takes of it.

595
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,435
So, there is hatred?

596
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:12,897
Well, I had it at first, and now, it's not just work,

597
00:37:12,922 --> 00:37:17,000
you just know that it's an enemy, that he
came, that he wants to do something with you.

598
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
If you don't kill him,
he will kill you.

599
00:37:20,433 --> 00:37:25,571
And this enemy has been here for a long time, and
he just needs to be eliminated, and that's it.

600
00:37:25,898 --> 00:37:29,000
Hatred, it's probably more
about civil people, because,

601
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:35,000
well, they view it in another way.

602
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,492
When you've been working...

603
00:37:38,386 --> 00:37:41,928
The biggest motivation for me
at the moment,

604
00:37:43,324 --> 00:37:49,000
obviously, is to return to our borders
and all that,

605
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:55,000
but I want revenge for the brother-in-arms, which
they killed because there won't be anyone like them.

606
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Do they come to you?

607
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,750
They come.

608
00:37:59,775 --> 00:38:01,000
Yes.

609
00:38:01,025 --> 00:38:02,990
Even recently, yes.

610
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:12,139
Decent people come, we work with them, and then they fit in the
team, in the family, in the unit,

611
00:38:12,177 --> 00:38:19,274
because you have not only to fit
in the unit by head, but also by heart.

612
00:38:19,299 --> 00:38:23,542
It is necessary to become not a
person in Azov, but the Azovian himself,

613
00:38:23,858 --> 00:38:28,653
There is a category, this is my...

614
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:29,871
Invention?

615
00:38:29,896 --> 00:38:31,000
Subjective opinion,

616
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:38,000
there are people who do it for money,

617
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
some do it for something else,

618
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,273
and there are people who just come,

619
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
I really hope that we don't have such people,

620
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:51,000
but there are people who come
purely for commercial purposes.

621
00:38:52,185 --> 00:38:52,975
In Azov?

622
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:58,939
Well, I don't think it is true for Azov, but in other units, yes.

623
00:39:00,557 --> 00:39:01,326
I know this...

624
00:39:01,351 --> 00:39:02,975
Do you condemn such people?

625
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Well, yes.

626
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Really?

627
00:39:05,497 --> 00:39:08,947
I'm paid one hundred thousand hryvnias,
it doesn't matter if I die.'

628
00:39:09,646 --> 00:39:10,975
Their motivation...

629
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
But they do the work.

630
00:39:12,025 --> 00:39:14,471
Yes, they work, but their motivation is money.

631
00:39:15,643 --> 00:39:28,334
How money can be a motivation when your country is being destroyed, civil people are dying, and children, and women?

632
00:39:31,009 --> 00:39:35,839
What other motivation is there? Money?

633
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
What if to consider it compensation

634
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,975
for the fact that you are freezing, working, digging?

635
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
In general, it doesn't bother me.

636
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:57,353
I would agree to compensate my
parents for the fact that my mother does not see her son.

637
00:39:59,195 --> 00:40:02,599
Let me eat, take a bath, and wash my clothes.

638
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,480
I don't need anything else.

639
00:40:06,651 --> 00:40:07,829
Okay.

640
00:40:08,582 --> 00:40:15,975
When I am a civilian, when the war
ends, then I will think about money,

641
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,369
how to build your civilian life further.

642
00:40:17,394 --> 00:40:18,406
But where...

643
00:40:18,431 --> 00:40:21,049
I mean, I understand it, but not really.

644
00:40:21,087 --> 00:40:24,423
I will go away,
and I will still think about your words.

645
00:40:24,448 --> 00:40:27,415
Look, everyone has their own story.

646
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,055
The money is important to someone.

647
00:40:32,189 --> 00:40:39,746
Maybe, someone is serving and
building a house at the time, or investing.

648
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:41,480
I do not judge.

649
00:40:41,505 --> 00:40:47,715
I'm telling the truth, it is my subjective opinion.

650
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:48,925
I think so.

651
00:40:48,976 --> 00:40:53,975
I do not impose my opinion on anyone,
it's just my point of view.

652
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,452
I am cool this way.

653
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Azov is such a unit, which
is shrouded in legends,

654
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,810
and the tragedy that happened in 2022.

655
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,840
There was a series of tragedies.

656
00:41:10,864 --> 00:41:19,387
Their exit, despite the order to save lives, is also a tragedy.

657
00:41:19,411 --> 00:41:24,414
Because later there were Olenivka and tortures.

658
00:41:24,771 --> 00:41:29,160
Do guys that have been through it tell you something?

659
00:41:29,827 --> 00:41:34,576
Do they talk sincerely? Are there moments of soldier truth?

660
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,502
Of course, there are.

661
00:41:36,526 --> 00:41:39,715
We try not to ask about it.

662
00:41:39,739 --> 00:41:43,487
We understand how it is there and what is going on there.

663
00:41:44,407 --> 00:41:56,070
We try not to bother them with it so that they do not
return in their thoughts to what they went through there.

664
00:41:56,887 --> 00:41:59,880
Personally, I understand what's going on there.

665
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:06,237
Everything is visible in their appearance
when they come out of captivity.

666
00:42:06,529 --> 00:42:10,190
Personally, I'm not interested. I never asked about it.

667
00:42:10,215 --> 00:42:18,507
If a person talks about it, just remembers the topic during
the conversation. 'We had it like that.' I would listen.

668
00:42:18,532 --> 00:42:23,920
I never ask, why, how, tell me. It's unpleasant for me to hear.

669
00:42:24,631 --> 00:42:26,930
I don't even talk about...

670
00:42:26,955 --> 00:42:28,552
How they survived it.

671
00:42:29,949 --> 00:42:38,893
Well, such fighters, such warriors,
can you recognise them among personnel?

672
00:42:38,918 --> 00:42:40,981
Are clearly visible?

673
00:42:41,006 --> 00:42:41,533
Yes.

674
00:42:42,033 --> 00:42:45,043
Certainly, there are no others here.

675
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:53,694
Of course, I completed the last combat mission.

676
00:42:53,719 --> 00:42:59,920
In general, I have a very young platoon.
All the guys are born starting from 2000.

677
00:43:01,385 --> 00:43:05,895
There are from 2002, 2003, 2004, even 2005.

678
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:06,773
Wow.

679
00:43:06,798 --> 00:43:19,134
Yes, and I just set a task for a person, and as much as I
am a psychologist, I immediately scan the reception.

680
00:43:19,586 --> 00:43:22,150
I don't see any doubts in their eyes.

681
00:43:22,904 --> 00:43:28,638
Or any pause, or that he is doubting something.

682
00:43:28,663 --> 00:43:32,651
A person completes the task.

683
00:43:32,676 --> 00:43:35,290
How did you earn this trust?

684
00:43:35,325 --> 00:43:46,159
Well, probably with the same system,
that I have never let them down.

685
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:50,870
Do you have to be completely honest with your subordinates?

686
00:43:50,895 --> 00:43:51,895
Never.

687
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:52,654
You can't.

688
00:43:52,679 --> 00:43:55,920
Once you slip up, and that's it.
There will be no trust.

689
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,920
You will not have that authority.

690
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,920
You should say directly what awaits them?

691
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:07,645
To say what awaits them as much as it is necessary
for them, as much as they are ready to accept it.

692
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:10,739
This is such a balance, you know.

693
00:44:10,824 --> 00:44:12,824
This must be understood.

694
00:44:12,849 --> 00:44:17,849
One needs to be given full information, one needs
only a part, and another needs to be given nothing.

695
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,991
It's like, you know, being a conductor.

696
00:44:21,571 --> 00:44:24,287
A creative person to command.

697
00:44:24,312 --> 00:44:27,698
Because each person has a personality.

698
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:32,920
And someone needs a kick, and someone just needs a conversation.

699
00:44:34,491 --> 00:44:42,920
You will know how to approach them only when you
are constantly on the same wavelength with them.

700
00:44:43,595 --> 00:44:47,722
And you will understand who is who.

701
00:44:47,747 --> 00:44:49,725
You need to live the lives of your fighters.

702
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:59,920
I'll tell you that when I think about how you can ask,
force, demand from a person to leave the Azovstal

703
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:03,446
when the person is in a complete block and surrounded.

704
00:45:04,485 --> 00:45:10,756
The human brain understands that you are going to meet death.

705
00:45:10,781 --> 00:45:13,746
How can you give such an order as a commander?

706
00:45:13,771 --> 00:45:16,920
How can you convince a person to go and do it?

707
00:45:17,405 --> 00:45:18,405
Look, here ...

708
00:45:19,379 --> 00:45:20,929
How did they do it?

709
00:45:20,954 --> 00:45:27,029
They did it, I think, based on their full trust in their commander.

710
00:45:27,054 --> 00:45:27,869
Yes, it is true.

711
00:45:27,894 --> 00:45:31,920
They, in the first place, for their commander, can go to the end

712
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:36,895
and perform the most difficult task in general.

713
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,920
We trust our commander.

714
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:41,920
They give us tasks, and we perform them.

715
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:46,920
This is, perhaps, one of the few links

716
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:53,379
that distinguish us from other units and in general in the world.

717
00:45:53,404 --> 00:45:57,920
Because we completely trust our commander.

718
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:58,920
Completely.

719
00:45:59,282 --> 00:46:00,920
And all our guys.

720
00:46:01,158 --> 00:46:03,920
The commander has a great deal of authority.

721
00:46:06,681 --> 00:46:11,920
With all these years, when the war is still going on, it is only growing.

722
00:46:15,273 --> 00:46:16,577
I will say one thing.

723
00:46:16,602 --> 00:46:23,920
The commander of the company, the commander of
the battalion, the commander of the brigade.

724
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:27,920
These are, I think, the most competent people,

725
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,442
the most authoritative people for me.

726
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,544
I don't need anything else.

727
00:46:33,569 --> 00:46:35,686
Well, it's worth serving with people like that.

728
00:46:35,711 --> 00:46:36,920
Yes, that's all.

729
00:46:37,369 --> 00:46:38,393
Even, you know ...

730
00:46:38,418 --> 00:46:39,540
Under their leadership.

731
00:46:39,565 --> 00:46:42,565
Our company commander.

732
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:50,895
We communicate with him long enough, for me it`s clearly to
understand when he is my friend and when he is my leader.

733
00:46:51,648 --> 00:46:54,920
I don't need to be reminded of it many times.

734
00:46:54,945 --> 00:46:56,945
How not to cross the line?

735
00:46:57,903 --> 00:46:59,920
Well, at work, when there is work, we ...

736
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,920
I know when he is my friend,

737
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:02,920
I know when he is my commander.

738
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,611
We work as commanders and subordinates.

739
00:47:04,636 --> 00:47:11,920
Sometimes we can come to talk to him,
go somewhere, drink coffee, have a snack.

740
00:47:12,287 --> 00:47:13,287
Yes.

741
00:47:13,535 --> 00:47:17,920
I talk to him frankly quite often.

742
00:47:18,753 --> 00:47:25,159
I stay with him, and we already have a
dialogue as two friends.

743
00:47:25,417 --> 00:47:31,401
And I told him frankly that, even though...
by the way, a company commander is a few years younger than me,

744
00:47:32,059 --> 00:47:37,248
I told him, even though he is younger than
me, I consider him my older brother.

745
00:47:37,609 --> 00:47:40,390
Well, I have respect for this person.

746
00:47:42,268 --> 00:47:47,629
And only in Azov, you can just
go to your company commander, talk to him,

747
00:47:49,763 --> 00:47:50,920
Soul to soul.

748
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:55,920
Only in Azov, the commander of the
battalion can tell you, Iraq, let's go eating.

749
00:47:58,337 --> 00:47:59,455
Just like that.

750
00:48:01,591 --> 00:48:03,920
Redis, tell me, what kind of person is he?

751
00:48:04,693 --> 00:48:05,920
A standard.

752
00:48:06,289 --> 00:48:08,920
What is the distance between you and him?

753
00:48:09,644 --> 00:48:13,920
Look, we don't see him very often,

754
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,920
because we have expanded into the brigade,

755
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:19,920
and he has a lot of his own work.

756
00:48:21,012 --> 00:48:28,920
When we were preparing for the task,
we worked on the tactical maneuvers,

757
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:30,920
and he was present,

758
00:48:30,945 --> 00:48:35,719
we communicated with him, he
was completely ... In the process.

759
00:48:35,744 --> 00:48:37,920
He was involved in our work,
he was interested ...

760
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:38,920
You can make a comparison.

761
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:43,332
You had a leader, well, with all respect
to your former leadership in the police.

762
00:48:43,357 --> 00:48:45,283
No, these were not leaders.

763
00:48:45,912 --> 00:48:46,920
These were not leaders.

764
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:47,920
Really?

765
00:48:47,944 --> 00:48:48,801
Really.

766
00:48:48,825 --> 00:48:49,825
These are not leaders.

767
00:48:49,850 --> 00:48:50,895
Not commanders,

768
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:52,176
these are not leaders.

769
00:48:52,201 --> 00:48:56,268
Here you see and understand
that this is a commander.

770
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:58,341
What is his strength?

771
00:48:59,098 --> 00:49:00,196
He is a commander.

772
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:05,609
He is simple, I don't know how to
say it correctly, he has humanity, so to speak.

773
00:49:05,753 --> 00:49:08,920
The compliance of his position.

774
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:09,548
Yes.

775
00:49:09,573 --> 00:49:12,078
He is a professional.

776
00:49:13,164 --> 00:49:17,564
You communicate with him,
you talk to him, he is constantly ...

777
00:49:17,589 --> 00:49:18,920
What is a professional?

778
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:25,775
In Azovstal, he went out in combat fights, right?

779
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:28,581
Now he is a commander, right?

780
00:49:28,606 --> 00:49:31,920
He is a commander,
but he goes to the front line,

781
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,443
he comes to our positions,
he comes to our command point.

782
00:49:34,468 --> 00:49:36,004
Directly to the front line.

783
00:49:36,029 --> 00:49:37,920
How does he make people comply?

784
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,920
How does it happen?

785
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:46,129
How is this magic, when you understand that this
person is an authority, an undisputed authority?

786
00:49:46,154 --> 00:49:48,472
He has such energy, I don't know how to explain it.

787
00:49:48,497 --> 00:49:52,007
His energy works with the subconsciousness.

788
00:49:52,032 --> 00:49:55,233
Yes, the subconsciousness.

789
00:49:55,258 --> 00:49:58,033
He works with trust.

790
00:49:58,818 --> 00:50:00,818
It is easy to talk to him.

791
00:50:01,090 --> 00:50:08,746
He addresses work issues clearly. Once we talked and
he asked, why do you want to do this way?

792
00:50:08,771 --> 00:50:10,134
And you tell him ...

793
00:50:10,159 --> 00:50:11,411
Do you communicate formally?

794
00:50:11,436 --> 00:50:14,663
No, he communicates informally with us.

795
00:50:14,688 --> 00:50:17,552
Calls us by our nicknames or 'friends'.

796
00:50:17,577 --> 00:50:18,198
Yes, asks, why is it so?

797
00:50:18,233 --> 00:50:24,057
And I explain to him, for example, well, here we
decided this way, because... and I am giving arguments.

798
00:50:25,064 --> 00:50:27,336
He listens.

799
00:50:27,361 --> 00:50:30,869
Or gives some order.

800
00:50:31,199 --> 00:50:33,494
He can also advise something.

801
00:50:33,731 --> 00:50:34,731
Then he says,

802
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:36,920
Iraq,
I want to see this.

803
00:50:38,196 --> 00:50:40,575
Well, I have my own conclusions,

804
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:43,470
I announce them to the personnel,
and we do it.

805
00:50:44,393 --> 00:50:46,920
The commander then approves,
yes or no.

806
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:57,920
Are commanders involved in personal matters?

807
00:51:02,050 --> 00:51:04,774
Well, not to say that they are involved.

808
00:51:04,799 --> 00:51:06,833
Well, if they are military matters or just...?

809
00:51:06,858 --> 00:51:08,072
No, your personal matters.

810
00:51:08,097 --> 00:51:09,478
No.

811
00:51:09,503 --> 00:51:12,354
Well, he can ask what's up.

812
00:51:12,379 --> 00:51:19,920
Well, if you initiate a personal conversation,
and you may need advice or help,

813
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:22,330
then you will be listened to,

814
00:51:22,355 --> 00:51:26,920
and there will be as much as possible help and effort for you.

815
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:30,507
Who finds out that the fighter is burning out?

816
00:51:30,532 --> 00:51:32,920
Who finds out that the fighter is on the edge?

817
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:35,586
Who finds out that the fighter needs psychological help?

818
00:51:35,611 --> 00:51:39,061
Brother-in-arms and the commander,
this is a common issue.

819
00:51:39,086 --> 00:51:41,051
Do you have some kind of warning?

820
00:51:41,076 --> 00:51:42,418
Yes,

821
00:51:42,443 --> 00:51:44,495
When you have to report about it.

822
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:49,920
The guys come up and say, friend,
the commander, pay attention to this and that.

823
00:51:50,926 --> 00:51:55,304
I literally sit down,
and I understand what he needs.

824
00:51:55,329 --> 00:52:01,363
One needs just a
conversation, as I said before,

825
00:52:01,388 --> 00:52:06,057
one just needs to miss the combat mission.

826
00:52:06,668 --> 00:52:09,805
Well, everyone carries the load in their own way.

827
00:52:09,830 --> 00:52:11,215
Just give them a rest.

828
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:17,042
That's it, the next time he goes to the
battle recovered, worked with himself, he's ready.

829
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:24,717
I personally had a case when a fighter came up to
me and said that it was morally difficult for him.

830
00:52:25,875 --> 00:52:28,264
He needed to rest because he...

831
00:52:28,289 --> 00:52:30,360
Do you ask about the reasons?

832
00:52:30,385 --> 00:52:34,110
Well, I understand, he's a combat doctor,

833
00:52:34,135 --> 00:52:37,535
a very good one who saved a lot of lives.

834
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:39,636
He's a robot.

835
00:52:39,661 --> 00:52:40,661
Who are you talking about?

836
00:52:40,686 --> 00:52:45,392
This is a platoon doctor, Circus, friend, a fighter of the 2nd platoon.

837
00:52:45,417 --> 00:52:51,663
He did a lot on this mission,
a lot of successful evacuations.

838
00:52:54,895 --> 00:52:57,564
He also has the same attitude towards his brother-in-arms,

839
00:52:57,589 --> 00:52:59,920
like, we are from the same course,

840
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:06,390
and it's very difficult for him, when
they get wounded, when they feel bad,

841
00:53:06,415 --> 00:53:12,873
when he needs to work,
he doesn't like it very much,

842
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:15,239
he says, when I need to
work, I don't like it very much,

843
00:53:15,264 --> 00:53:17,264
because everything is fine
when he doesn't work,

844
00:53:17,311 --> 00:53:18,311
but when he works,

845
00:53:18,336 --> 00:53:20,116
he helps someone,

846
00:53:20,141 --> 00:53:22,050
it's hard for him,

847
00:53:22,075 --> 00:53:24,732
he carries everything in himself,

848
00:53:24,757 --> 00:53:26,920
he is also a professional in his field,

849
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:31,920
and then, if something goes wrong, he sits for hours and think

850
00:53:31,945 --> 00:53:33,468
whether he did the right thing,

851
00:53:33,493 --> 00:53:38,324
although he is, a professional, and I trust
him, as well as the commander of the company,

852
00:53:38,349 --> 00:53:41,567
everyone in our company knows what he can do.

853
00:53:41,592 --> 00:53:45,498
As the commander of another platoon, I also trust him

854
00:53:47,205 --> 00:53:59,920
We train young people who come to
us, that, in our company, we don't have,

855
00:54:00,165 --> 00:54:03,404
the second platoon, the
third platoon, the first platoon,

856
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:08,920
Yes, it exists legally,
we have the first platoon.

857
00:54:08,945 --> 00:54:13,895
For my personnel, my friend Spartan, it's an authority.

858
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:26,895
We train every soldier that we are one platoon, and if there are difficulties
or problems in the second platoon, it can`t be not interesting for the third platoon,

859
00:54:27,624 --> 00:54:32,379
We do the same work, protect the same country.

860
00:54:32,404 --> 00:54:39,181
The last combat mission we
had, we did with two platoons, together

861
00:54:39,206 --> 00:54:44,019
and the guys,
communicated and interacted well with each other.

862
00:54:44,981 --> 00:54:57,170
Guys, at the age of 18, under shelling, under
enemy grenade drop carried food and water for the guys,

863
00:54:57,929 --> 00:55:08,099
clearly understanding that because of this
bottle of water, this distance, he can not return.

864
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:13,196
Why do they go to you at the age of 18?

865
00:55:14,346 --> 00:55:15,814
Why do they go?

866
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:18,622
Because they are carrying, that's it.

867
00:55:19,907 --> 00:55:20,811
That's it.

868
00:55:20,836 --> 00:55:25,474
They do not need to look for additional motivation.

869
00:55:26,557 --> 00:55:32,927
They are the cream of the nation, as
they say, these 18-year-olds and 19-year-olds.

870
00:55:32,953 --> 00:55:34,953
Who protect their country.

871
00:55:36,253 --> 00:55:42,013
To be honest, I do not communicate
with anyone, except for Spartan,

872
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:43,920
and that's it.

873
00:55:44,107 --> 00:55:48,216
I do not know what it was before.

874
00:55:50,145 --> 00:55:57,583
You know, with the beginning of
all this that happened to our country.

875
00:55:57,608 --> 00:56:04,262
Everything fell into place, everyone
showed their true colors.

876
00:56:05,172 --> 00:56:13,920
I'm tired of watching Instagram
stories of people who used to surround me,

877
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,920
who I still follow,

878
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:18,547
who don't know what to do with themselves.

879
00:56:19,226 --> 00:56:22,355
Theater, hookah, park.

880
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:26,038
Theater, karaoke.

881
00:56:26,063 --> 00:56:31,906
People have so much free time that
they don't know how to deal with it.

882
00:56:33,417 --> 00:56:38,920
When I come home and my blood pressure is 160

883
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:42,920
and I don't know which pill to take,

884
00:56:43,442 --> 00:56:47,880
I normalize blood pressure with one medicine,
but my headache doesn't go away.

885
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:48,920
And so on.

886
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:49,920
He is 34.

887
00:56:53,792 --> 00:57:00,527
My mom texts me,
asking when she will see me.

888
00:57:01,775 --> 00:57:02,920
At least for a day.

889
00:57:05,743 --> 00:57:07,241
Someone else goes to karaoke.

890
00:57:09,557 --> 00:57:10,424
And a beach.

891
00:57:10,449 --> 00:57:10,920
Yes.

892
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:11,920
Soon there will be one.

893
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,320
Soon there will be a beach.

894
00:57:13,405 --> 00:57:14,920
In these months.

895
00:57:19,832 --> 00:57:22,309
I can ask about these red threads,

896
00:57:22,334 --> 00:57:23,646
but there will be no answer.

897
00:57:23,671 --> 00:57:24,832
I can answer.

898
00:57:24,857 --> 00:57:25,857
I also can.

899
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:26,656
Really?

900
00:57:26,681 --> 00:57:30,107
It's easier for him.
He knows more about it.

901
00:57:30,132 --> 00:57:33,796
My mom put it on me and said to wear it.

902
00:57:33,821 --> 00:57:34,231
Really?

903
00:57:34,256 --> 00:57:34,878
Yes.

904
00:57:36,228 --> 00:57:38,163
So there is someone more important than Redis.

905
00:57:38,188 --> 00:57:39,920
Yes.

906
00:57:42,662 --> 00:57:44,203
I am a faithful man.

907
00:57:45,815 --> 00:57:46,895
That's it.

908
00:57:47,809 --> 00:57:51,287
Then again, I don't impose it upon anyone.

909
00:57:51,312 --> 00:57:53,920
I have my attitude
and treat it my own way.

910
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:56,423
That's it.

911
00:57:56,740 --> 00:58:01,920
Listen, guys, does ideology weigh a lot in Azov?

912
00:58:02,564 --> 00:58:04,863
Yes.

913
00:58:05,505 --> 00:58:10,698
Did you accept it before you were tested?

914
00:58:10,723 --> 00:58:11,660
Probably yes.

915
00:58:11,685 --> 00:58:16,659
You do not accept it,
it comes to you on its own, subconsciously.

916
00:58:16,684 --> 00:58:17,684
Yes.

917
00:58:18,948 --> 00:58:20,920
It's stupid to impose it.

918
00:58:22,261 --> 00:58:26,058
How can you force to love your country, your nation?

919
00:58:26,083 --> 00:58:27,510
You won't say,
that you have to do it.

920
00:58:27,535 --> 00:58:28,642
To be a patriot.

921
00:58:28,667 --> 00:58:31,276
To speak from a script like the Russians.

922
00:58:31,311 --> 00:58:34,358
You know, they have scripts.

923
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:37,647
We don't do it.

924
00:58:38,006 --> 00:58:42,883
When it comes to you,
you go to Azov.

925
00:58:43,163 --> 00:58:44,163
That's how I think.

926
00:58:44,895 --> 00:58:51,224
Without it, you can't come here, get here,
go through the course, get all these loads.

927
00:58:52,453 --> 00:58:55,356
You understand why you are here.

928
00:58:55,381 --> 00:58:59,730
It helps you morally and psychologically.

929
00:58:59,755 --> 00:59:02,920
You have a fighting spirit all the time
because you know why you are here,

930
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:05,945
what you will do, and why you are doing it.

931
00:59:05,970 --> 00:59:07,920
An attitude towards Azov.

932
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,920
Do you feel it?

933
00:59:11,201 --> 00:59:15,920
Are there people who look at your chevron from the bottom up?

934
00:59:15,954 --> 00:59:19,361
Well, they look in different ways.

935
00:59:23,388 --> 00:59:24,920
They look in different ways.

936
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:29,920
I don't know who looks at me
from the bottom up or from the negative side.

937
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:34,920
Certainly, the looks aren't indifferent.

938
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:38,825
Well, in Kyiv, they look at me normally.

939
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:43,242
Here, when I come home to my relatives, it's fifty-fifty.

940
00:59:43,267 --> 00:59:43,920
Really?

941
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:44,920
Well, yes.

942
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:50,920
We were in Kyiv sometime ago with Spartan
and with two of our brother-in-arms.

943
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,406
I don't even remember why.

944
00:59:52,431 --> 00:59:55,920
We were exempt for two days.

945
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:57,920
We were going by the subway.

946
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:00,920
We were wearing T-shirts.

947
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:04,402
At that time, SPSD Azov had a T-shirt.

948
01:00:04,427 --> 01:00:05,955
It was given to you?

949
01:00:05,980 --> 01:00:08,711
Women and girls came up to us.

950
01:00:08,736 --> 01:00:10,320
They just said, thank you.

951
01:00:10,345 --> 01:00:11,283
It was uncomfortable.

952
01:00:11,308 --> 01:00:12,814
Very uncomfortable, honestly.

953
01:00:12,839 --> 01:00:16,673
The guys didn't do anything.

954
01:00:16,708 --> 01:00:18,895
It's harder for the guys.

955
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:20,920
Grandmothers and grandfathers are sitting on the benches.

956
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:22,920
You pass by, they look at you like this.

957
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:25,920
They think, are you a fascist?

958
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:26,469
Really?

959
01:00:26,494 --> 01:00:27,084
Yes.

960
01:00:28,761 --> 01:00:30,920
Well, you see how people look at you.

961
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:31,397
Yes.

962
01:00:31,422 --> 01:00:32,350
Someone looks at you normally.

963
01:00:32,375 --> 01:00:33,387
Someone respects you.

964
01:00:33,512 --> 01:00:36,788
Someone thinks that you are a punisher of Russian children.

965
01:00:36,813 --> 01:00:37,813
And that's it.

966
01:00:37,895 --> 01:00:42,003
If not an Azov officer, but an officer from the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

967
01:00:42,028 --> 01:00:42,920
Do they look at you differently?

968
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:46,889
I think they look at everyone the same way,
but the Azov officer is just special.

969
01:00:47,711 --> 01:00:51,920
So, they are good boots as they said that
in Soviet film comedy, you have to take them.

970
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:52,920
Yes.

971
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:56,767
Then again, Russian script works well for those who watch it.

972
01:00:56,792 --> 01:01:00,593
It's all those old people who watch these...

973
01:01:00,618 --> 01:01:01,920
Well, not only old people.

974
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:04,920
There are also adults, basically people who ...

975
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:08,658
You are looking at him and he has his own cinema there.

976
01:01:08,683 --> 01:01:10,519
He watched a lot of Pervyi Channel.

977
01:01:11,443 --> 01:01:18,044
Well, when we were going here,
we saw a satellite that is on every house.

978
01:01:18,069 --> 01:01:22,915
They used to be set up for Moscow.
I don't know what they are watching.

979
01:01:23,209 --> 01:01:25,546
I think they watch the same thing.

980
01:01:25,570 --> 01:01:29,808
Did we do something to cut the signal? It is possible to do?

981
01:01:29,833 --> 01:01:37,486
To be honest, I don't know, but if I had any
direct relation to this, I would do it in the first place.

982
01:01:37,511 --> 01:01:48,058
If people are still watching in 2024,
and everything is not that simple.

983
01:01:50,182 --> 01:01:52,415
They have problems with their heads.

984
01:01:53,336 --> 01:01:55,191
They shouldn't live here, at least.

985
01:01:55,216 --> 01:02:05,920
I'm not saying that they should be killed, they just need to be
put on a train or bus and let them go there, beyond the curb.

986
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:07,895
That's it.

987
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:15,368
We want to build our country, so that
everyone is a patriot, so that everyone loves it.

988
01:02:15,393 --> 01:02:18,353
And we want to bring back the Ukrainian spirit.

989
01:02:18,378 --> 01:02:20,360
Everyone wears Vyshyvanka.

990
01:02:20,385 --> 01:02:21,920
This is my favorite topic.

991
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:23,546
Everyone loves it terribly, you know.

992
01:02:23,571 --> 01:02:26,726
Yes, they love it terribly.

993
01:02:26,751 --> 01:02:29,464
They love it terribly at their homes.

994
01:02:29,489 --> 01:02:37,418
Language, faith, church, and you know, everyone is kissing,
and as a result, we have corrupt people in Vyshyvankas.

995
01:02:37,443 --> 01:02:39,751
Yes, it is so.

996
01:02:39,776 --> 01:02:41,895
I forgot to ask,

997
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:45,920
you said that you wanted to go to the unblocking, right?

998
01:02:45,945 --> 01:02:50,895
When the guys came out and you looked
at these shots, what did you think?

999
01:02:51,208 --> 01:02:52,920
What were your feelings then?

1000
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:54,920
Well, it hurt a lot.

1001
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:56,920
It must have been a feeling of compassion.

1002
01:02:57,643 --> 01:03:07,761
I understood why it happened. Because it was necessary
to help the heavily wounded or they would have just died.

1003
01:03:09,253 --> 01:03:11,253
They would've died.

1004
01:03:11,566 --> 01:03:12,920
Everyone understood.

1005
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:14,657
It was just hard to understand.

1006
01:03:14,682 --> 01:03:23,740
Even, well, I think that even civilians
understand that our enemy cannot be trusted.

1007
01:03:23,765 --> 01:03:31,920
The pre-agreements according to which they came out,
were not, unfortunately, fulfilled by them.

1008
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:35,655
No third party would lift a finger.

1009
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:52,259
I was 90% sure that it was for washing the eyes, to show, from their side,
that they still have some kind of military honor, some military rules of war.

1010
01:03:53,481 --> 01:04:01,219
In fact, we have seen, we see it to this day,
how they behave and what they do there.

1011
01:04:01,477 --> 01:04:11,323
That's why further negotiations, it's a joke.

1012
01:04:11,947 --> 01:04:13,920
So how will this war end?

1013
01:04:15,390 --> 01:04:25,099
I think it will end sooner or later with our victory,
but it should end on their territory.

1014
01:04:27,696 --> 01:04:30,920
When our army will be there.

1015
01:04:31,845 --> 01:04:37,431
When we can impose on them our conditions, then we will win.

1016
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:44,577
This is, well, like, this is my subjective opinion.

1017
01:04:44,602 --> 01:04:46,920
Well, there is war mathematics.
There are fewer of us.

1018
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:48,546
Yes, there are fewer of us.

1019
01:04:48,571 --> 01:04:50,777
So, in this decision, something needs to be corrected.

1020
01:04:50,802 --> 01:04:52,548
Well, if...

1021
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:56,920
There hasn't been such a turning point yet.

1022
01:04:56,920 --> 01:04:58,543
It hasn't happened yet.

1023
01:04:58,568 --> 01:05:00,269
It will happen someday.

1024
01:05:00,294 --> 01:05:05,790
It will happen, no matter how many there are of us and them.

1025
01:05:07,244 --> 01:05:09,633
According to the number of the army.

1026
01:05:09,658 --> 01:05:14,200
When this moment comes, it will stop working.

1027
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:29,031
Already during the full-scale war, I think that our army has already proven
this many times and shown that the number does not always matter.

1028
01:05:29,559 --> 01:05:41,111
If we use our strength correctly and effectively, use the weapons
that we are given, I hope that they keep giving it to us, help us,

1029
01:05:41,812 --> 01:05:54,104
and not hold us on this leash, and our unit in general, which
is not provided with Western weapons and equipment at all.

1030
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:56,594
And then, if we do all this...

1031
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:59,501
Do you not have Western or American weapons?

1032
01:05:59,526 --> 01:06:01,526
We have ...

1033
01:06:01,551 --> 01:06:03,012
Or is this war secret?

1034
01:06:03,037 --> 01:06:04,037
Okay, that's it.

1035
01:06:04,062 --> 01:06:06,395
We may already have it, but only from the state.

1036
01:06:06,537 --> 01:06:08,157
Not from the state?

1037
01:06:08,182 --> 01:06:08,997
Yes.

1038
01:06:09,022 --> 01:06:11,511
Well, from volunteers and good people.

1039
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:23,541
Although, our higher management has already asked,
what else we have to do to be given it.

1040
01:06:23,566 --> 01:06:24,723
What else to prove?

1041
01:06:24,748 --> 01:06:27,531
I want to say to the viewers that we will also have a fundraising.

1042
01:06:27,556 --> 01:06:29,895
This fundraising will be for the Azov brigade.

1043
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:34,403
The only thing is that now I can't say whether it
will be for medical needs or for military needs.

1044
01:06:34,428 --> 01:06:40,083
Because I will talk to your management
and we will already decide with them.

1045
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:45,920
It was said by the youth about the picture of the end of the war.

1046
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:47,586
And now wisdom will speak.

1047
01:06:47,611 --> 01:06:48,231
Yes.

1048
01:06:48,256 --> 01:06:49,256
What?

1049
01:06:49,573 --> 01:06:50,573
Ask.

1050
01:06:51,166 --> 01:06:53,366
What do you see as the end of the war?

1051
01:06:53,391 --> 01:06:54,920
Of course, our victory.

1052
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:57,920
We will do everything for this.

1053
01:06:57,920 --> 01:06:58,920
Everything.

1054
01:06:59,435 --> 01:07:01,920
Beginning with a soldier to an officer.

1055
01:07:03,423 --> 01:07:04,704
And we are doing everything for this

1056
01:07:04,729 --> 01:07:05,920
and we keep doing.

1057
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:07,506
As I said earlier.

1058
01:07:07,531 --> 01:07:10,423
As long as we have enough strength

1059
01:07:11,312 --> 01:07:13,920
we will not give up.

1060
01:07:17,899 --> 01:07:27,488
Honestly, sometimes I get tired, let's say, morally.

1061
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:35,895
But I tell you, I have enough motivation for a long time.

1062
01:07:36,535 --> 01:07:38,391
When will you cut your hair, Iraq?

1063
01:07:38,416 --> 01:07:45,423
I will cut my hair after we are withdrawn from this direction.

1064
01:07:45,448 --> 01:07:47,105
Then I will cut my hair.

1065
01:07:50,565 --> 01:07:51,920
This is some kind of ...

1066
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:54,450
Well, my superstitions.

1067
01:07:56,052 --> 01:08:07,949
During some period I determined for myself, I do not cut my hair.

1068
01:08:09,307 --> 01:08:12,720
Well, I hope that you will soon see a friend with a haircut.

1069
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:14,013
He has already cut himself.

1070
01:08:14,038 --> 01:08:18,557
He already sends me photos and says, this is how I want it.

1071
01:08:18,582 --> 01:08:19,920
So that you cut your hair.

1072
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:20,920
Yes, yes.

1073
01:08:20,944 --> 01:08:22,015
So that he looked like a human.

1074
01:08:22,039 --> 01:08:23,659
Thank you very much.

1075
01:08:23,684 --> 01:08:24,920
Thank you for this conversation.

1076
01:08:24,945 --> 01:08:26,895
Thank you for the interview.

1077
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:27,920
Thank you.

1078
01:08:28,631 --> 01:08:29,540
I just came.

1079
01:08:29,565 --> 01:08:33,524
Hello. My name is Ilya.
Brigade Azov. National Guard of Ukraine.

1080
01:08:33,549 --> 01:08:35,540
Oh, Azov. Cool. Let's work.

1081
01:08:35,565 --> 01:08:36,334
Okay, good.

1082
01:08:36,359 --> 01:08:38,022
By the way, we are not Nazis.

1083
01:08:39,543 --> 01:08:42,826
Oh. Yes. I understood. Yes.

1084
01:08:43,175 --> 01:08:48,508
Well, society expects that the next day,
after the end of the war, there will be elections.

1085
01:08:48,533 --> 01:08:55,918
Therefore, all the soldiers whom they love, value,
and who they`re grateful to, will come to the Verkhovna Rada.

1086
01:08:55,943 --> 01:08:56,943
Expecting.

1087
01:08:57,364 --> 01:08:58,086
They want.

1088
01:08:58,111 --> 01:08:59,735
Not just the Verkhovna Rada.

1089
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:03,537
Then again, there are wishes and there are reality.

1090
01:09:03,562 --> 01:09:04,840
Are they wanting you in the politics?

1091
01:09:04,865 --> 01:09:05,865
Well, yes.

1092
01:09:05,890 --> 01:09:09,409
Those people who bribe very often act like a puppeteer.

1093
01:09:09,434 --> 01:09:09,831
Well yes.

1094
01:09:09,856 --> 01:09:13,928
I do not like such people and I am very suspicious of them.

1095
01:09:13,953 --> 01:09:19,100
Does the front line now look like it is in a positional impasse?

1096
01:09:19,667 --> 01:09:24,358
No, the front line is moving, everywhere, Russians are pushing.
