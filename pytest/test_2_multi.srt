1
00:00:10,578 --> 00:00:12,659
[male]: Yes, a nurse is needed, carefully.

2
00:00:13,739 --> 00:00:15,320
[male]: But you have no work experience.

3
00:00:15,496 --> 00:00:16,511
[female]: But I have a diploma.

4
00:00:16,841 --> 00:00:17,421
[male]: Careful.

5
00:00:18,401 --> 00:00:19,222
[male]: This is a centrifuge.

6
00:00:20,538 --> 00:00:21,643
[male]: God bless you.

7
00:00:21,883 --> 00:00:22,522
[female]: Good afternoon.

8
00:00:22,729 --> 00:00:23,704
[male]: What did you say?

9
00:00:23,729 --> 00:00:25,344
[female]: I told I have a diploma.

10
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:26,105
[male]: A diploma is good.

11
00:00:27,456 --> 00:00:28,056
[male]: What is this?

12
00:00:28,797 --> 00:00:30,138
[male]: So they brought him here?

13
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:32,279
[male]: No, it was in the box.

14
00:00:32,339 --> 00:00:35,160
[male]: It just didn't fit in the box.

15
00:00:35,695 --> 00:00:36,941
[male]: This is an ultrasound.

16
00:00:37,402 --> 00:00:38,082
[male]: It's super complicated.

17
00:00:38,122 --> 00:00:39,443
[male]: It costs twenty thousand euros.

18
00:00:39,463 --> 00:00:39,783
[male]: Do you understand?

19
00:00:39,823 --> 00:00:40,644
[male]: That's not possible!

20
00:00:40,804 --> 00:00:41,604
[male]: Chief, everything is fine.

21
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:44,046
[male]: This isn't the first medical thing that cost 20,000 I've driven.

22
00:00:44,764 --> 00:00:45,486
[male]: Really?

23
00:00:45,859 --> 00:00:46,827
[male]: Ok, first time.

24
00:00:47,153 --> 00:00:48,553
[male]: So where is it?

25
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,350
[male]: To the left.

26
00:00:49,707 --> 00:00:50,429
[male]: And carefully.

27
00:00:50,514 --> 00:00:51,460
[male]: Come on.

28
00:00:52,675 --> 00:00:56,533
[male]: Excuse me, but why did you work as a journalist, a blogger?

29
00:00:57,908 --> 00:00:59,749
[male]: Did you even do cinema?

30
00:00:59,774 --> 00:01:00,801
[female]: A very dubious story.

31
00:01:01,292 --> 00:01:02,620
[female]: Maybe later I'll tell you.

32
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:03,681
[male]: Julia.

33
00:01:05,332 --> 00:01:09,110
[male]: Nursing is, first of all, experience, practice.

34
00:01:09,227 --> 00:01:12,489
[male]: I need a qualified general nurse.

35
00:01:12,514 --> 00:01:13,416
[female]: Yes, I…

36
00:01:13,441 --> 00:01:15,048
[male]: Not for taking pots.

37
00:01:15,328 --> 00:01:17,109
[female]: Wait, I can not just taking pots.

38
00:01:17,388 --> 00:01:23,661

[male]: Doctor!

45
00:01:36,762 --> 00:01:37,302
[male]: Doctor!

46
00:01:38,851 --> 00:01:41,078
[male]: Doctor, Kobita is here...

47
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:45,295
[male]: What is he saying?

48
00:01:45,375 --> 00:01:47,136
[male]: I understood two words at most.

49
00:01:47,161 --> 00:01:50,322

50
00:01:50,437 --> 00:01:51,038
[male]: What happened?

51
00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:54,380
[male]: I say Kobita...

52
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:57,061
[male]: It`s about fruit, I know, but what's the point here?

53
00:01:57,201 --> 00:01:59,923
[male]: And he says he brought a woman who had a car accident on the road.

54

[male]: So what can we do?

56
00:02:02,384 --> 00:02:03,285
[male]: The hospital is closed.

57
00:02:03,365 --> 00:02:04,105
[male]: Yes, show me.

58
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:06,827

59
00:02:06,852 --> 00:02:07,456
[male]: Show me.

00:03:09,121 --> 00:03:09,662

71
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:11,651
[female]: Because we need to make anticonvulsant and analgesic.

[female]: Are you serious?

83
00:03:42,911 --> 00:03:44,693
[male]: Mind your own business.

84
00:03:49,822 --> 00:03:50,898

00:04:03,828 --> 00:04:04,948
[male]: And that`s my CV.

[male]: Let`s look at stomach.

97
00:04:16,963 --> 00:04:18,589
[male]: The stomach needs immediate surgery.

98
00:04:18,614 --> 00:04:19,490
[male]: How to operate?

99
00:04:19,515 --> 00:04:20,976
[male]: Our operating room is not ready.

100
00:04:21,393 --> 00:04:22,591
[male]: The electricity is unstable.

101
00:04:22,616 --> 00:04:24,117
[male]: We don't have an expert opinion.

102
00:04:24,142 --> 00:04:26,078

00:04:43,217 --> 00:04:45,698
[male]: Listen, this evacuation is making me nervous.

107
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:48,880
[male]: I have patients in Odessa, you can see the sea, but what about here?

108
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,201
[male]: The painful back and also there is smell of gasoline.

110
00:04:55,006 --> 00:05:00,809
[female]: I need you with Semen, Semen, don't get in the backpack, to take you out from under the shelling that's getting on my nerves.

111
00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:01,789
[female]: So I'll take you out.

112
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,710
[female]: And you sit there, silently missing Odessa.

113
00:05:04,735 --> 00:05:05,671
[female]: Because I'm driving.

114
00:05:05,737 --> 00:05:07,738
[female]: I don't have time for your nostalgia.

115
00:05:07,882 --> 00:05:10,899
[male]: Oh, it's hard to breathe.

116
00:05:11,554 --> 00:05:12,514

00:05:12,691 --> 00:05:13,795
[female]: Father, what is it?

118
00:05:13,998 --> 00:05:18,812
[male]: Baby, you should probably drop me off, and I'll get better and catch up with you in Poland.

119
00:05:18,837 --> 00:05:21,279
[male]: As healthy as a doorman in a metropolis.

120
00:05:21,658 --> 00:05:22,405
[female]: Okay.

121
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:24,444

00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:44,934
[male]: I think so.

128
00:05:45,054 --> 00:05:46,992
[male]: You said you were a surgeon.

129
00:05:47,017 --> 00:05:47,897
[male]: What experience do you have?

130
00:05:47,922 --> 00:05:48,947
[male]: What specialization?

131
00:05:48,972 --> 00:05:50,183
[female]: An outstanding gynecologist.

132
00:05:50,693 --> 00:05:52,099
[female]: And a talented schemer.

00:05:52,124 --> 00:05:54,085
[female]: Specializes in women, mostly beautiful ones.

134
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:56,246
[female]: Simply put, a rare fool.

135
00:05:56,986 --> 00:05:58,086
[female]: I haven't forgotten anything, Kovalev.

136
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:02,821
[male]: Sorry, but this is not your profile.

137
00:06:02,846 --> 00:06:04,395
[male]: A person has everything close together inside.

138
00:06:05,047 --> 00:06:05,976
[male]: Take a look.

139
00:06:07,215 --> 00:06:08,256
[male]: This is a piece of metal.

140
00:06:08,616 --> 00:06:10,136
[male]: It needs to be removed, treated, and sewn up.

141
00:06:10,156 --> 00:06:10,996
[male]: I can handle this.

142
00:06:13,253 --> 00:06:14,457
[male]: You will assist.

143
00:06:15,315 --> 00:06:16,135
[male]: Let's go.

144
00:06:18,163 --> 00:06:19,218
[female]: Come on.

145
00:06:19,815 --> 00:06:20,737
[male]: Thank you.

146
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:26,328
[male]: Panel...

147
00:06:29,624 --> 00:06:35,657
[male]: Tighten it here, tighten it there and it should work.

148
00:06:37,549 --> 00:06:38,749
[male]: Why aren't you working?

149
00:06:38,789 --> 00:06:39,830
[male]: Are you a plastic surgeon?

150
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,901

00:06:46,758 --> 00:06:49,655
[male]: Yes, my mother is from here in Poltava and her parents are too.

153
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,605
[male]: Why isn't this pile of junk metal working?

154
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:54,388
[male]: Can we increase the pressure or add lubricant?

155
00:06:55,007 --> 00:06:56,619
[male]: Oh, you're an anesthesiologist?

156
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,021
[male]: Yes, Nazar from Ternopil.

157
00:07:00,104 --> 00:07:01,874
[male]: Yes, guys, go away.

158
00:07:08,838 --> 00:07:10,458
[male]: Are you an osteopath or a traumatologist?

159
00:07:10,483 --> 00:07:11,458
[male]: I am Polish.

160
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:17,960
[male]: It's clear that the light will go out.

161
00:07:19,211 --> 00:07:22,769
[male]: I'm after the details, because it's only enough for an hour at most.

162
00:07:23,656 --> 00:07:24,697
[male]: What did he say?

163
00:07:25,022 --> 00:07:26,588
[male]: That he's our fairy godmother.

164
00:07:29,799 --> 00:07:30,957
[male]: Where is your doctor?

165
00:07:30,982 --> 00:07:31,748
[male]: I don't know.

166
00:07:31,772 --> 00:07:33,108
[female]: He don`t know.

167
00:07:33,646 --> 00:07:34,466
[female]: Doctor!

168
00:07:34,491 --> 00:07:35,591
[female]: Doctor, can you come here?

169
00:07:35,616 --> 00:07:36,387

[male]: My heart is hurting.

173
00:07:40,488 --> 00:07:41,228
[male]: It's hard to breathe.

174
00:07:41,248 --> 00:07:42,289
[male]: It`s burning here.

175
00:07:42,949 --> 00:07:43,644
[male]: Yes, okay.

176
00:07:44,265 --> 00:07:46,017

177
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:47,932
[male]: Sit down.

178
00:07:48,191 --> 00:07:49,316
[male]: Merik!

179
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,251
[male]: Merik, we have a patient.

180
00:07:51,711 --> 00:07:52,952
[male]: Suspected heart attack, be careful.

181
00:07:53,012 --> 00:07:55,832
[female]: Father, please don't die, I beg you.

182
00:07:55,852 --> 00:07:57,253
[male]: Mom, I feel bad too.

183
00:07:58,184 --> 00:07:59,006
[female]: Sioma!

184
00:07:59,031 --> 00:07:59,801
[female]: Sioma!

185
00:07:59,826 --> 00:08:00,856
[female]: What are you?

186
00:08:02,165 --> 00:08:03,201
[male]: What about you?

187
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:05,492
[male]: I feel nauseous and my stomach hurts.

188
00:08:06,505 --> 00:08:08,627
[female]: I told you not to eat that hot dog at the gas station.

189
00:08:08,652 --> 00:08:09,775
[male]: Mom, calm down.

190
00:08:09,815 --> 00:08:11,817
[male]: Now we'll do some tests and find out everything.

191
00:08:13,138 --> 00:08:13,759
[male]: Mom.

192
00:08:13,819 --> 00:08:14,880
[male]: Where he`s so long?

193
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,641
[male]: It's already an hour.

194
00:08:16,056 --> 00:08:17,203
[male]: Marco!

195
00:08:17,502 --> 00:08:18,443
[male]: Yes, take the boy.

196
00:08:18,468 --> 00:08:20,589
[male]: Let's go, carefully.

197
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:36,492
[female]: A complete violation of security rules.

198
00:08:38,086 --> 00:08:39,515
[female]: I don't even have a belt.

199
00:08:40,202 --> 00:08:41,632
[female]: And you too, by the way.

200
00:08:41,657 --> 00:08:43,479
[male]: And there's nowhere for the belt to put on.

201
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:47,205
[male]: And in general, when there's a war, such little things don't matter.

202
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:49,121
[female]: When there is war, everything matters.

203
00:08:49,146 --> 00:08:51,863
[male]: But there is something more important, I'm taking it now.

204
00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:55,932
[female]: Oh, we passed the speed limit sign, by the way.

205
00:08:57,145 --> 00:08:59,147
[female]: You have much more on your speedometer.

206
00:08:59,446 --> 00:09:01,747
[male]: Don't look there, look ahead.

207
00:09:01,767 --> 00:09:05,869
[female]: God forbid it shakes and I have to clean the car afterwards.

208
00:09:06,489 --> 00:09:08,670
[male]: I am, dear, now being chased by the weight of death.

209
00:09:08,695 --> 00:09:09,591
[female]: Yes, I see.

210
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,122
[female]: Are you in a hurry to the cemetery?

211
00:09:12,434 --> 00:09:14,937
[male]: I'm rushing to the hospital where a person is dying.

212
00:09:15,437 --> 00:09:17,679
[male]: Because in the hospital there is a complete mess and there is no electricity.

213
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:22,444
[male]: And you, young lady, are carrying salvation in your arms for the head of the same TG.

214
00:09:22,484 --> 00:09:24,486
[male]: So please hold it more gently.

215
00:09:24,587 --> 00:09:27,649
[male]: What are you doing! Idiot!

216
00:09:28,184 --> 00:09:30,353
[female]: Please, at least follow the vocabulary!

217
00:09:44,387 --> 00:09:45,657
[female]: Good afternoon.

218
00:09:45,682 --> 00:09:46,808
[female]: Hello, girls.

219
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:47,641
[female]: I'm Shura.

220
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,975
[female]: Galya.

221
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,722
[female]: Julia.

222
00:09:50,147 --> 00:09:51,243
[female]: New nurse.

223
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:55,190
[female]: And that guy who watched our Margarita with you, is he your husband?

224
00:09:55,712 --> 00:09:56,912
[female]: Galya.

225
00:09:57,107 --> 00:09:59,049
[female]: That's how they look on men.

226
00:09:59,271 --> 00:10:00,808
[female]: And she looked at him like that.

227
00:10:01,508 --> 00:10:02,509
[female]: This is her ex.

228
00:10:03,825 --> 00:10:05,870
[female]: This is the level of analytics, that's what I understand.

229
00:10:06,157 --> 00:10:08,552
[female]: Can you analyse in the same way when the war is over?

230
00:10:09,016 --> 00:10:10,464
[female]: We don't think about war at all.

231
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,783
[female]: Can we not think about it?

232
00:10:13,936 --> 00:10:16,197
[female]: If you think about it, you might get a heart attack.

233
00:10:16,217 --> 00:10:19,998
[female]: And then who will clean, disinfect, and cook here?

234
00:10:20,296 --> 00:10:22,125
[female]: By the way, do you know how to cook?

235
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,044
[female]: I can.

236
00:10:23,419 --> 00:10:26,940
[male]: If she knew how to cook, men would be attracted to her.

237
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,721
[female]: And you'll remember scrambled eggs until you retire, right?

238
00:10:30,121 --> 00:10:33,602
[female]: Oh, that man doesn't know how to fry eggs yet, he's not a man at all.

239
00:10:34,403 --> 00:10:35,626
[male]: What?

240
00:10:36,151 --> 00:10:38,272
[female]: I'm saying we've already disinfected the operating room.

241
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,402
[female]: You go and work.

242
00:10:41,033 --> 00:10:41,634
[female]: Doctor.

243
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:43,695
[female]: Girls, shall we work together?

244
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,482
[female]: Done.

245
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,133
[female]: Cool, right?

246
00:10:46,973 --> 00:10:47,809
[male]: Hello.

247
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,437
[male]: The generator is about to die.

248
00:10:49,477 --> 00:10:50,878
[male]: Serhiy went to get spare parts.

249
00:10:50,903 --> 00:10:53,384
[male]: Galya asked to bring some toilet duck.

250
00:10:53,409 --> 00:10:55,390
[male]: I said, the animal shouldn`t be in the hospital.

251
00:10:55,415 --> 00:10:57,002
[male]: It's detergent.

252
00:10:57,027 --> 00:10:59,042
[male]: Will we have some kind of a manager?

253
00:10:59,133 --> 00:11:00,903
[male]: It won`t be.

254
00:11:00,928 --> 00:11:02,424
[male]: But I can make you.

255
00:11:02,444 --> 00:11:02,744
[male]: Do you want it?

256
00:11:03,004 --> 00:11:03,544
[male]: I am a doctor.

257
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:04,844
[female]: Good afternoon.

258
00:11:05,615 --> 00:11:08,336
[female]: I was told that the hospital is open here.

259
00:11:08,582 --> 00:11:10,477
[male]: No, we open tomorrow.

260
00:11:11,077 --> 00:11:12,818
[female]: Then excuse me, I'll go.

261
00:11:13,784 --> 00:11:14,558
[male]: Wait.

262
00:11:15,204 --> 00:11:17,039
[male]: The doctor will examine you.

263
00:11:17,479 --> 00:11:18,540
[male]: Malifan, take the patient.

264
00:11:18,565 --> 00:11:19,720
[male]: Sorry, I can't.

265
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:20,271
[male]: Why?

266
00:11:20,296 --> 00:11:21,318
[male]: You are not busy right now.

267
00:11:21,477 --> 00:11:24,478
[male]: So get ready and come take a look.

268
00:11:24,706 --> 00:11:26,071
[male]: I'll show you around.

269
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:26,976
[male]: But how?

270
00:11:27,001 --> 00:11:28,032
[male]: I am alone.

271
00:11:29,181 --> 00:11:30,927
[male]: I need some kind of nurse.

272
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:34,304
[female]: Are you trying to control me?

273
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,783
[male]: I want to make sure you don't screw up.

274
00:11:37,637 --> 00:11:38,536
[male]: Mosquito.

275
00:11:40,073 --> 00:11:41,192
[female]: I'm not screwing up.

276
00:11:42,026 --> 00:11:44,594
[male]: I'm not sure, cat, because it's not a mosquito, but a bilort clamp.

277
00:11:45,292 --> 00:11:47,279
[female]: That's why I won't tolerate you again.

278
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:52,489
[male]: As a gynecologist, I advise you not to tolerate, but to do your job.

279
00:11:52,514 --> 00:11:55,581
[male]: And, if you can, relax and enjoy yourself.

280
00:11:55,922 --> 00:12:00,344
[male]: Colleagues, I need help examining a patient.

281
00:12:00,424 --> 00:12:02,838
[male]: She's so aggressive that she has to be held?

282
00:12:03,188 --> 00:12:06,219
[male]: I don't understand what you mean?

283
00:12:06,365 --> 00:12:08,705
[female]: He asks why you can't examine it yourself?

284
00:12:09,008 --> 00:12:10,200
[male]: Because it's protocol.

285
00:12:10,225 --> 00:12:12,273
[male]: I can't examine a woman without a witness.

286
00:12:12,522 --> 00:12:15,327
[male]: There is no such protocol in Ukraine, so go and do what you have to.

287
00:12:15,347 --> 00:12:16,327
[male]: And God is your witness.

288
00:12:16,421 --> 00:12:18,740
[male]: God's testimony is not admissible in court.

289
00:12:18,765 --> 00:12:19,487
[male]: Tongs.

290
00:12:21,392 --> 00:12:22,226
[male]: Well, so what?

291
00:12:24,728 --> 00:12:25,589
[male]: Well, that's it.

292
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:30,572
[male]: Now we'll sew up the patient and you can take Yulia away forever.

293
00:12:30,876 --> 00:12:33,285
[male]: Just my personal advice – don't marry her.

294
00:12:34,494 --> 00:12:36,376
[male]: Okay, I'll wait.

295
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:41,385
[female]: Needle, please, and sew up your black man's mouth.

296
00:12:41,933 --> 00:12:44,194
[male]: Kitty, kitty, you used to like it.

297
00:12:44,219 --> 00:12:44,639
[female]: No, no, no.

298
00:12:44,664 --> 00:12:45,370
[female]: When was that?

299
00:12:46,878 --> 00:12:48,361
[male]: Generator went out.

300
00:12:48,386 --> 00:12:49,887
[male]: Hurry up, drainage and tampon.

301
00:12:49,912 --> 00:12:53,354
[female]: It seems our patient did not allow the hospital to be connected to the village network.

302
00:12:53,379 --> 00:12:55,758
[male]: Nothing, we won't let this karma come true.

303
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:56,777
[male]: Come on.

304
00:12:56,802 --> 00:12:57,602
[female]: Thank you.

305
00:12:57,627 --> 00:12:58,807
[female]: So, how are my men?

306
00:12:58,832 --> 00:13:00,459
[male]: Everything will be fine, don't be nervous.

307
00:13:00,484 --> 00:13:02,566
[male]: Now we'll just measure the temperature and pressure.

308
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,905
[male]: Mom, I don't have any pain anymore.

309
00:13:05,965 --> 00:13:07,246
[male]:  I think I'm feeling a bit sick.

310
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:08,499
[female]: Well, yes.

311
00:13:09,848 --> 00:13:11,271
[male]: The temperature is good.

312
00:13:11,956 --> 00:13:14,798
[male]: Oh, my heart is pounding.

313
00:13:15,071 --> 00:13:16,572
[male]: Mr. Josef, now.

314
00:13:17,257 --> 00:13:18,251
[male]: One second.

315
00:13:19,114 --> 00:13:20,635
[male]: I want to draw.

316
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:26,036
[male]: It's good that the heart monitor is battery-operated.

317
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:28,300
[male]: Wow!

318
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:33,023
[male]: You have pressure like an astronaut.

319
00:13:35,585 --> 00:13:36,932
[female]: What are you saying?

320
00:13:38,136 --> 00:13:40,267
[female]: Dad, what was that?

321
00:13:42,424 --> 00:13:44,865
[female]: Well, what are you doing, like a potato in a frying pan?

322
00:13:45,104 --> 00:13:47,383
[female]: I understand that you don't want to go.

323
00:13:47,411 --> 00:13:49,652
[female]: But to manipulate the fact that I'm worried about you.

324
00:13:51,133 --> 00:13:54,434
[male]: My heart ached with longing for my native Odessa.

325
00:13:55,158 --> 00:13:57,760
[male]: Baby, what will I do in that Poland?

326
00:13:58,236 --> 00:13:59,823
[male]: There I`m a respectable person here.

327
00:14:00,062 --> 00:14:01,703
[male]: Joseph L. Pinfelfein.

328
00:14:01,929 --> 00:14:02,877
[male]: Who's there?

329
00:14:03,111 --> 00:14:04,375
[male]: An old Jew?

330
00:14:04,638 --> 00:14:05,976
[male]: Yosya is a pensioner.

331
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:10,369
[female]: Dad, it's because I'm worried about you and I'm taking you away from this damn war.

332
00:14:11,129 --> 00:14:16,279
[female]: So now I'm going to go, buy some water, nausea lozenges and we're leaving, okay?

333
00:14:22,671 --> 00:14:25,506
[male]: Grandpa, I was painting a bad cardiogram for you.

334
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:26,934
[male]: And bad tests.

335
00:14:28,513 --> 00:14:30,723
[male]: You are my little sunshine.

336
00:14:30,862 --> 00:14:33,004
[male]: You're my darling.

337
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,632
[male]: I don't want to go either.

338
00:14:36,657 --> 00:14:37,798
[male]: But you can't lie.

339
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,487
[male]: No, you can't.

340
00:14:40,095 --> 00:14:45,161
[male]: No, Siomochka, mom is doing the right thing by taking you away from here.

341
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:47,814
[male]: And me as the old man is better off here.

342
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:49,857
[male]: This is my land.

343
00:14:50,162 --> 00:14:51,469
[male]: My life.

344
00:14:51,494 --> 00:14:53,261
[male]: – And mine too.
